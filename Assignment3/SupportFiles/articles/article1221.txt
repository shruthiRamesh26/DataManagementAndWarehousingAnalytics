economist urges more taxes to lower nz dollar wellington oct an income tax surcharge and capital gains tax could bring about an urgently needed depreciation of the nz dollar independent economist len bayliss said bayliss a former economist with the reserve bank and the bank of new zealand said a major depreciation is needed to restore export competitiveness even if inflation is cut by current government policies the taxes would help cut the budget deficit which in turn would lower the value of the nz dollar he said in a speech he added that the deficit for the year ending march could be much higher than the governments billion dlr forecast since the government was unlikely to cut expenditure as a percentage of gross domestic product a major tax increase was probably unavoidable bayliss said he would have preferred an increase in the pct valueadded goods and services tax introduced in october but that would have had a shortterm inflationary impact import tariffs should be lowered to minimise the inflationary impact of a currency depreciation the government had failed to bring inflation down despite lower oil prices and an appreciation in the currency he added new zealands inflation rate was pct in the year to endseptember against pct in the year to end june the major deficiency in the governments antiinflation policies was reliance on high interest and exchange rates and insufficient emphasis on reducing the budget deficit bayliss said the government had also failed to reduce overseas debt and debt ratios and cut the balance of payments deficit the widespread belief that new zealands problems are going to take much longer to solve than was originally thought is soundly based primarily because the governments macroeconomic policies have been unsuccessful bayliss said reuter
