competition toughens for nearsupercomputers by catherine arnst boston oct an announcement by alliant computer systems inc ltalnt of a new lowend nearsupercomputer and lteta systems incs unveiling of a highend machine in the same category show competition is stiff in this market industry analysts said consultants said alliants new fx computer aimed mainly at scientists and researchers will be priced between and dlrs and will be faster than anything else in that price range but they said alliant is trying to bring prices in line with discounts it now gives many of its customers the new fx is significant to the extent that it represents alliants recognition of the reality of the marketplace said a source who was briefed by alliant on the new computer the list price is more in line with what they are seeing anyway nearsupercomputers often called minisupercomputers resemble the massive supercomputers favoured by scientists but are much less expensive and a quarter as powerful supercomputers cost well over one mln dlrs but minisupercomputers are generally priced between dlrs and one mln dlrs most nearsupercomputers use a new computer architecture called parallel processing in which a problem is broken up into segments and each segment assigned to a different processor generalpurpose mainframe computers have just one processor that works on one segment of a problem at a time making them too slow for complex scientific problems nearsupercomputers have been in existence for only about five years and the two leading manufacturers alliant and convex computer corp cnvx held two of the most successful initial public offerings last year but alliant and convex a texas company are also facing some companies competing for between and mln dlrs in sales this year and the result has been lower prices and shrinking profit margins heavy discounting slow acceptance outside the scientific market lack of software and too many competitors also have made analysts reassess prospects for nearsupercomputers jeffrey canin computer analyst with hambrecht and quist said he just added a year to his original growth estimates for the industry he now expects sales to reach billion dlrs in instead of in recent weeks both alliant and convex have said their third quarter earnings would be reduced by competitive pricing pressures alliant said profits for the period will be about five cents a share against eight cents last year although revenues for the period rose to mln dlrs from mln convex said third quarter earnings will be less than the second quarters cents a share while revenues will rise almost eight mln dlrs over the third quarter to between and mln dlrs until now most of the price discounting occurred at the bottom of the product line in nearsupercomputers but eta systems announcement could start squeezing convex and alliant from the top analysts said eta a subsidiary of control data corp ltcdc introduced two machines that are really fullblown supercomputers similar to those sold by cray research inc the worlds biggest supercomputer maker but at half the price of crays cheapest model the eta model p costs dlrs and the model q is mln dlrs eta officials told a news conference the new machines may be classified as supercomputers but they are aimed directly at the upper end of the product lines from alliant and convex acceptance of etas product could be hampered by lack of software analysts said noting this is an issue that faces all parallel processor makers to some degree because parallel processing is a new architecture that has yet to be widely used third party software vendors have been slow to write programs for the nearsupercomputers eta however offers a low priced entry into supercomputers for some customers one consultant said canin cautioned that the price pressures will continue for some time and estimated that five percentage points have been knocked off the gross profit margins of both convex and alliant this year by price discounting next year he said the two companies will face a new set of problems as they both introduce their second generation of products i am always cautious about the first major product transition reuter
