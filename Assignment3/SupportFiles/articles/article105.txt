us coffee import reporting system questioned by susan zeidler new york oct a voluntary compliance system for monitoring us coffee imports under quotas is viewed skeptically by many in the coffee industry said analysts and trade sources many sectors of the trade including large roasters and importers are adamant against voluntary compliance because of the past which was subject to tremendous irregularities as it became a matter of the trade monitoring each other one analyst said on monday a national coffee association newsletter said the office of us trade representative will implement a voluntary compliance system temporarily because legislation to monitor imports is tied up in the congressional trade bill under the arrangement milar to one in coffee importers would voluntarily present needed documents to the us government until congress approves the monitoring authority but if coffee arrives without valid certification it will still be allowed entry while many believe producers will not seek to add to the overburdened stock situation in the us others believe some will ship outside of the quota requirements in lieu of monitoring controls trade sources said last time there was a lot of false information submitted to customs which resulted in a lot of indictments and fines a us customs spokesman said customs can do a good job when given the tools but when its hands are tied it doesnt have the authority to demand form o documents tracking merchandise from source to destination he said many see it as a true test of whether producers and importers will abide by the quota system it is a key to seeing whether there are any teeth in the quota agreement said one major us roaster last time we had a gentlemans agreement the trade did not act as a gentleman said another analyst adding without the need to submit documents the ball will be in the producers hands some feel that importers will take advantage of the voluntary compliance due to development of a twotier market in which nonmember countries buy coffee at a big discount many fear that dealers will buy coffee destined for nonmember countries at discounts and then bring it into the us falsely labelled according to customs officials several green coffee importers confessed in that they had imported coffee fraudulently after buying it for nonmember destinations forging landing certificates and then relabelling it as navy beans if theres that much of a discrepancy between prices for one country and another producers may be teted to get rid of their stocks of coffee by selling to nonmember nations and by circumventing the quota provisions said paine webber analyst bernie savaiko still others believe that producers will not be hard pressed to aggravate the overburdened coffee stock situation in the us in the near term it would be naive to suggest that any agreement would not have some share of connivance but i think the voluntary system seemed to suffice and coupled with the fact that we have so much coffee i dont think that it poses that much of a threat one trader said reuter
