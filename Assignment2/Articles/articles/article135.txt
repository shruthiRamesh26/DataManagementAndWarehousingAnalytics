2  NO PRESSING NEED FOR SOVIET WHEAT SUBSIDY  LYNG       WASHINGTON Oct 20    The Soviets have not indicated an urgent need for a US wheat subsidy offer and it is unlikely that such an offer will be ma during the USSoviet summit expected to be held next month Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng told Reuters     In an exclusive interview with Reuters Lyng said he did not know if the United States will offer Moscow another wheat subsidy offer this year or when that offer will be made     Last year it was well into the year before we offered it Theres been nothing thats taken place to indicate to me that theres a pressing need on their part for that sort of deal a wheat subsidy     When asked if a subsidy would be offered at a USSoviet summit Lyng said No I dont think so I dont think that     The Agriculture Secretary said a US wheat subsidy deal to Moscow would not be the kind of topic appropriate for discussion at a summit     It would not be the kind of issue that the President or the Chairman would get into specific negotiations or discussions about Lyng said     When Mr Nikonov communist party secretary for agriculture was here  he indicated that trade in wheat was not something that would be discussed with the President of the United States He said its not presidential Lyng said     Lyng said uncertainties about wheat quality in some major producing areas of the world volatile wheat prices and the still unfinished Soviet grain harvest could delay any final decision on the timing of another wheat subsidy to Moscow     The future of the USSoviet longterm grains agreement will be discussed the first of next year Lyng said but the Agriculture Secretary questioned the benefits of the longstanding agreement     Weve had three years in a row in which the Soviets have failed to live up to their end of the agreement  We would love to continue to keep doing busines with the Soviet Union but do we need a longterm agreement Who benefits from that These are some of the questions we need to discuss     When asked if he felt the United States has benefitted from the agreement Lyng said I dont know It certainly hasnt been what we had hoped it would be For three years running theyve Moscow failed to live up to what we considered was an agreement  Reuter 3
