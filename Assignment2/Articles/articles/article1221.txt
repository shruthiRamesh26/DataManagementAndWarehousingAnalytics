2  ECONOMIST URGES MORE TAXES TO LOWER NZ DOLLAR       WELLINGTON Oct 19    An income tax surcharge and capital gains tax could bring about an urgently needed depreciation of the NZ Dollar independent economist Len Bayliss said     Bayliss a former economist with the Reserve Bank and the Bank of New Zealand said a major depreciation is needed to restore export competitiveness even if inflation is cut by current government policies     The taxes would help cut the budget deficit which in turn would lower the value of the NZ Dollar he said in a speech He added that the deficit for the year ending March 1988 could be much higher than the governments 13 billion dlr forecast     Since the government was unlikely to cut expenditure as a percentage of gross domestic product a major tax increase was probably unavoidable Bayliss said     He would have preferred an increase in the 10 pct valueadded goods and services tax introduced in October 1986 but that would have had a shortterm inflationary impact Import tariffs should be lowered to minimise the inflationary impact of a currency depreciation     The government had failed to bring inflation down despite lower oil prices and an appreciation in the currency he added     New Zealands inflation rate was 169 pct in the year to endSeptember against 189 pct in the year to end June     The major deficiency in the governments antiinflation policies was reliance on high interest and exchange rates and insufficient emphasis on reducing the budget deficit Bayliss said The government had also failed to reduce overseas debt and debt ratios and cut the balance of payments deficit     The widespread belief that New Zealands problems are going to take much longer to solve than was originally thought is soundly based  primarily because the governments macroeconomic policies have been unsuccessful Bayliss said  REUTER 3
