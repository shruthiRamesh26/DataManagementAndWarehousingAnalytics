2  TREASURYS BAKER UNDER FIRE FOR WALL STREET DROP       By Alver Carlson       WASHINGTON Oct 20    As official Washington sought to restore investor confidence after Mondays Wall Street collapse Treasury Secretary James Baker came under fire from critics who claimed he helped to precipitate the crisis     Bakers weekend blast at the West German Bundesbank for boosting interest rates seemed to signal an unraveling of an international accord to stabilize currency values     Nigel Lawson British Chancellor of the Exchequer was among those who said the treasury secretarys statements helped spur a wave of stock sales by making already jittery investors think that a clash between the two major economic powers would damage the world economy     Lawson told a London television interviewer Tuesday I think the scale of the stock fall was very great That I think was partly due to statements that have been made by senior figures on the other side of the Atlantic It was a dispute that should never have happened he added     Although Baker appeared to patch over the rift at a hastilycalled meeting with West German officials Monday he   still faced a storm of criticism on his return to the United States on Tuesday Baker cut short a longplanned trip to Scandinavia to return here to deal with the economic crisis     Said one US analyst of Bakers weekend remarks His timing could not have been worse     One government bond salesman in New York said He actually thought that yelling at the Germans and threatening to smack the dollar down would work That doesnt show much understanding of international monetary gamesmanship     However some analysts said West Germanys stubborn march toward higher interest rates may have forced Bakers hand     On the surface Baker may look responsible for this but if you go back to see what caused it unsettling of financial markets it was West German policy said Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities International in New York     All Mr Baker did was to mention the obvious in public so making him responsible for it was a little like killing the messenger he said     After Mondays talks the US and West German governments made it clear that the Louvre currency accord pieced together in Paris in February was still in effect     Wall Street feared that collapse of the agreement might be a prelude to hyperinflation and economic malaise similar to the late 1970s Analysts believe Mondays Wall Street crash wiped out about 500 billion dlrs in stock values    Treasury sources said that Baker already unhappy about Bonns refusal to stimulate its economy in order to keep the global recovery moving was angered by a Bundesbank interest rate boost that seemed destined to do just the opposite     He felt that the US recovery inching along in its 59th month could no longer be the only engine of global economic expansion A growing US economy has been serving as a huge market for debtor country exports     Moreover Baker the consummate politician was worried that the Republican party might face next years presidential election with its main showpiece  a vibrant economy  badly tarnished     A rise in global interest rates might worsen the debt crisis and completely choke off US economic growth that has already slowed to a tepid 32 pct annual rate     Theres no doubt that it can have an adverse effect on the economy and its important that the psychology turn around quickly or else obviously the panic will feed on itself and eventually therell be a serious price to pay economically former deputy Treasury Secretary Richard Darman said in a television interview     In many ways the official response was mild     Washington was stunned by the sudden Wall Street retreat with President Reagan speaking for most people by admitting that he was puzzled     US government sources said the secretary immediately returned to the Treasury to be briefed on market developments and presumably their political impact     For all of this it seems unlikely that Bakers status in Washington will diminish because of the market fall     Asked by reporters if somebodys head should roll because of the Wall Street retreat Texas Democratic Senator Lloyd Bentsen said with some irony Oh I think its much too late to be doing thatYou have an administration thats taken the attitude that we can put the country on automatic pilot and  retire to the living room to take a nap You just cant do that  Reuter 3
