2  LOUVRE REAFFIRMATION NOT ENOUGH  UK ANALYSTS       By Rowena Whelan       LONDON Oct 20    US And West German reaffirmation of support for the Louvre Accord cannot cure the fundamental problems bedevilling the world economy which lie behind the current collapse in stock markets London economists said     Theres going to have to be some acknowledgement that the dollar is going to be allowed to slip said Richard Jeffrey of Hoare Govett If not there is going to be continued fear that when pressure emerges on the dollar the Fed will be forced to tighten This throws up the economic abyss of recession in the US With obvious knock on effects on the rest of the world     But some economists added that Wall Streets crash which dragged other major markets down with it may help curb the very problems that sparked the turmoil  namely world inflation fears and the massive and persistent US Trade deficits     If there is a benefit from a 23 pct fall in Wall Street Its some sort of resistance to inflation worldwide said Geoffrey Dennis of brokers James Capel echoing comments from other London and Tokyo analysts     Lower personal wealth from lower stock prices and fears of further falls should dampen credit growth curbing inflationary pressures and import demand in the US They say     Such considerations may be helping bond markets resist the equity crash according to Mike Osborne of Kleinwort Grieveson     It would be suicidal for any government in the context of what happened in the last couple of days to jack up their interest rates he added     Stocks surged after news Chemical Bank cut its prime lending rate half a point to 925 pct Tuesday and US Fed chairman Alan Greenspan pledged support for the financial system     The news eroded the most immediate fears that the stock collapse would spill over into the economy via a banking crisis for example thus precipitating recession     It also helped the dollar rally sharply to a high of 18200 marks from a European low of 17880 But economists said todays whiplash moves do not have long term significance and that markets should try to keep the underlying fundamentals in mind     The United States has been able to live on borrowed time If the effect of this crash is to produce slower economic growth not recessionIt contains good news and provides a more realistic assessment of the US Economy said Capels Dennis But he added that markets are still very much in danger     The liquidity doesnt disappearAll its doing is disappearing from the equity markets Dennis noted     David Morrison of Goldman Sachs International said world market turbulence will be exacerbated if the Group of Seven G7 leading western nations confirms a base for the dollar as implied by West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenbergs remarks that intervention to support currencies is still on     Last weeks dollar fall was partly triggered by expectations that the Germans were more worried about the money supply impact of such intervention than maintaining currency stability     But rigid adherence to dollar ranges would be bad said Morrison The Louvre Accord is fundamentally misconceived To stabilise the dollar at too high a level is wrong he said  Reuter 3
