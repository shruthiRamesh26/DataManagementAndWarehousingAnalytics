2  TEXACO ltTX EXPECTS TEXAS COURT TO HEAR CASE       HOUSTON Oct 20    Texaco Inc chairman Alfred DeCrane said the company anticipates that the Texas State Supreme Court will agree to hear its 103 billion dlr legal battle with Pennzoil Co ltPZL over ownership of Getty Oil     We expect that the Texas Supreme Court will hear our case will heed the voices of impartial third parties and will ultimately reverse this unjust decision and thus provide the simple basic justice that Texaco has asked for all along DeCrane said in a speech at a meeting of the International Association of Drilling Contractors     DeCrane said he expected the Texas State Supreme Court to overturn a State Appeals Court ruling that found Texaco unlawfully interfered with Pennzoils 1984 plan to acquire Getty Oil     This case has become much more than a quarrel between two companies DeCrane said It presents a far broader threat to our economic system and to justice in America as we know it today         Settlement talks between the two oil companies to resolve the billion dlr lawsuit reportedly stalled earlier this year when the US Securities and Exchange Commission filed a friend of the court brief in support of Texaco     The agency claimed Pennzoil violated SEC rule 10B13 which prohibits the purchase of shares privately at the same time a tender offer is outstanding     DeCrane also said concerns expressed by 19 state attorneys general in the legal proceedings also favored Texacos position     The bottom line is that the SEC had intervened to insure that its rule are interpreted properly in the interest of millions of private stockholders around the country who might some day find themselves the victim of this same kind of manipulation DeCrane told the oilmen     He warned that if the state appeals court judgment was upheld in Pennzoils favor it would send out of state businesses fleeing from Texas in droves     Texaco filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the US bankruptcy code last April after a state appeals court upheld Pennzoils 103 billion dlr judgment         Texacos appeal of the decision to the Texas State Supreme Court has been pending for several weeks and the court is expected to decide soon whether it will agree to review the lower court ruling     If the Texas State Supreme Court does not hear the case Texaco has said it will take its case to the US Supreme Court  Reuter 3
