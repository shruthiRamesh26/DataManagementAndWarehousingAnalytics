2  JAPANESE STOCK PLUNGE RAISES FUNDING PROBLEMS       By James Kynge       TOKYO Oct 20    The massive plunge in Tokyo stock prices on Tuesday could rob the Government of muchneeded revenue to spur Japans economy and may hurt banks ability to lend abroad analysts polled by Reuters said     The Japanese Government is depending on the sale of NTT Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp ltNCCTT shares for much of its public spending budget said Shigeo Suzuki a deputy general manager at the Industrial Bank of Japan     Japan had hoped to raise at least 5000 billion yen from the sale of 195 mln NTT shares on November 10     However the 149 pct plunge in the Tokyo share index today has made such plans look unrealistic analysts said     The government could defer the sale of NTT or they could offer fewer shares said Keikichi Honda general manager of economic research at the Bank of Tokyo Ltd     Honda said another possibility is that the underwriters handling the NTT sale would have to pay the Government the amount it expected to get and bear the brunt of any losses themselves That is what underwriting means he added     A Finance Ministry official confirmed that the government planned to go ahead with its sale of NTT shares on November 10     Another possible effect of Tokyos stock tumble would be to seriously undermine the asset base of Japanese banks     The banks lend money all over the world and regard the market value of stock holdings as assets analysts said     Japanese banks make loans using perhaps as much as 60 to 70 pct of the market value of their unrealised stock holdings as assets said Industrial Banks Suzuki     There is also concern that Japanese companies which have invested heavily in Tokyos stocks as their real business declined over the last two years have sustained heavy losses     Many companies mainly exportoriented companies were planning on selling their shares for a profit to reinvest in real businesses as the economy begins to pick up said one analyst at a foreign brokerage That prospect now looks dim     But analysts said it is unlikely companies or financial institutions will be bankrupted by losses in stock trading     I dont think any company is so badly exposed in stock investments said a senior analyst at Nomura Research Institute In terms of financial institutions luckily the rebounding bond market and currency markets are still profitable he added     The Nomura analyst said a 10 pct decline in Tokyo stocks would be translated into a fall of about 02 pct in consumer spending Some 20 pct of Tokyo stocks are owned by individuals     Market capitalisation on the Tokyo Stock Exchange fell to 329588 billion yen on Tuesday from 386041 billion at Mondays close     NTT shares ended 260000 yen lower at 265 mln each well down from their peak of 318 mln in April  REUTER 3
