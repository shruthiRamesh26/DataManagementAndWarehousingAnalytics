2  SENATE BACKS US RETALIATION IN GULF       WASHINGTON Oct 20    The US Senate on Tuesday backed President Reagans retaliatory strike against Iranian targets in the Gulf as it moved to take a greater role in making policy in the volatile region     Senators voted 921 for a nonbinding measure that endorsed Mondays US attack on two Iranian oil platforms in retaliation for an Iranian attack last Friday on a Kuwaiti ship flying the American flag     The measure said the attack was a firm indication of US resolve that Iran cannot take military action against the United States with impunity     Earlier the Senate cut off Republican stalling tactics and set a vote on a measure that could give Congress a larger role in making Gulf policy The measure however does not require Reagan to comply with the 1973 War Powers Act which could lead to a pullout of US forces from the Gulf     While Democrats and Republicans praised the US retaliatory strike many voiced new fears about the growing US involvement in the Gulf and some demanded that Reagan comply with the War Powers Act  Reuter 3
