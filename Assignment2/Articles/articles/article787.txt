2  LATEST ATTACK SEEN POINTING UP DILEMMAS FOR US       By CHRISTOPHER HANSON       WASHINGTON Oct 19    Military experts say the United States faces a dilemma in the Gulf following US destruction of an Iranian oil platform in retaliation for an attack on a USflagged tanker     The experts told Reuters Tehran holds the initiative and is likely to control the tempo and direction of the conflict as long as America simply reacts to Iranian attacks by launching limited retaliatory strikes     But if Washington seizes the initiative with bolder steps  such as mining Irans harbors blockading its shipping or destroying key bases  it could find itself in a major war     Iran is in the drivers seat in an absolute sense as the cycle of attack and retaliation continues said Fred Axelgard a Gulf War expert with the private Center for Strategic and International Studies CSIS     Its like a Greek tragedy said retired Adm Eugene Carroll of Washingtons private Center for Defense Information CDI think tank     Some Middle East experts say the only way out is for Washington to join forces with Moscow in pressing for an end to the war between Iran and Iraq     They say it is not feasible for America to withdraw its 30ship force from the Gulf area where the Navy began escorting USflagged Kuwaiti tankers in July Withdrawal  would give the appearance of being chased away by Iran which President Reagan could never accept     US Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger told a Pentagon news conference the destroyers Kidd Young Leftwich and Hoel fired about 1000 rounds of fiveinch shells at Irans Rostam oil rig 120 miles east of Bahrain beginning at about 1400 Gulf time 0700 EDT on Monday     Weinberger said the platform had been used as a military base by Iran and that the attack responded to an Iranian Silkworm missile strike on the USflagged Kuwaiti tanker Sea Isle City on Friday     Iranians manning the platform were warned in advance and allowed to escape     We do not seek further confrontation with Iran but we will be prepared to meet any escalation of military action by Iran with stronger countermeasures Weinberger said     We consider this matter closed he said     Analysts ranging from the liberal CDI to conservatives agreed the US reaction was measured reasonable and did not escalate the conflict unduly But they said the question was whether Iran would consider the matter closed It had not taken this view after earlier clashes  Reuter 3
