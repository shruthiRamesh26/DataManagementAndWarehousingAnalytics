2  POEHL SAYS RATE RISES ARE CAUSE FOR CONCERN       FRANKFURT Oct 20    Rises in West German and international interest rates are a cause for concern and the Bundesbank has no interest in higher capital market rates Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl said     We consider the interest rate increase that has occurred here and internationally to be a problem and cause for concern Poehl told an investment conference     I would like to stress that the Bundesbank has no interest in higher capital market rates he said     Shortly after Poehl spoke the Bundesbank announced a tender for a securities repurchase pact at a fixed rate of 380 pct     Previous tenders over the last month by interest rate have seen the allocation rate on these facilities rise to 385 pct at last weeks pact from 360 on the last fixedrate tender in late September     The Bundesbanks reduction of the key allocation rate to 380 from 385 pct was heralded Monday by repeated injections of money market liquidity at between 370 and 380 pct     These moves to cap interest rates followed a meeting between Poehl Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg and US Treasury Secretary James Baker Monday in Frankfurt     Officials said afterwards the three men had reaffirmed their commitment to the Louvre accord on currency stability     Over the weekend criticism by Baker of the tightening in West German monetary policy had prompted a sharp fall of the dollar on speculation that Louvre cooperation had ended     But the dollar rallied on news of Mondays meeting in nervous trading to trade above 179 marks Tuesday     Poehl said that the recent rise in interest rates was not due to central bank policy but to markets expectations and currency developments     Commenting on the inflationary expectations Poehl said You have to get to the root of the problem you have to pursue a policy which reveals that there are no grounds for such fears  The inflationary fears were unjustified and exaggerated he said     Poehl rebuffed recent US Criticism of West Germany saying the Bundesbank had made a substantial contribution to international cooperation in interest and monetary policy     The Bundesbank has tolerated an overshooting of its money supply target arousing criticism from other quarters he said     Today we still have lower interest rates than at the end of 1986 Quite the contrary of other countries where interest rates have risen substantially more Poehl said     This had to be taken into account when considering recent rises in repurchase pact allocation rates which were due to rising international money market rates that had spilled over into the German market he said     Poehl expressed surprise that financial markets had so far ignored improvements in the US Deficits     The adjustment process in the US Trade balance is definitely underway he said noting that this was not so noticeable in absolute figures     The spectacular improvement in the budget deficit had also attracted little attention he said  REUTER 3
