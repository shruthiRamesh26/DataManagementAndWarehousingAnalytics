2  US RULED OUT ATTACK ON IRANIAN SILKWORMS       WASHINGTON Oct 20    US military planners ruled out Irans Silkworm missiles as a target in the retaliatory attack mounted on Monday for fear of being drawn more deeply into the IranIraq war defense and Middle East experts said     US naval forces destroyed an offshore oil platform and raided another in what the administration called a measured and appropriate response to an Iranian Silkworm missile attack last Friday on a USflagged tanker in Kuwaiti waters     Private analysts generally agreed that going after the rig rather than an onshore economic or military target such as Silkworm launch sites reflected a careful bid by Washington to limit the political military and diplomatic fallout both at home and in the Gulf     It simply demonstrated the United States will take military action when they Iran take military action Norman Polmar a defense analyst and author said     He said hitting the platforms had spared Iran the embarrassment of casualties on its own soil possibly avoiding an escalating spiral of attack and counterattack     In addition it minimized the risk to US forces and the potential embarrassment of any losses including aircraft that could have been shot down had they taken part in an attack     Anthony Cordesman author of a new book on the IranIraq war said the United States apparently chose a limited target to keep alive the possibility that UN Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar might still persuade Iran to accept a Security Council call for a ceasefire     We want the UN peace initiative to work if theres any chance at all he said adding that the action made it clear tougher steps would follow if Iran to attack Gulf shipping     In targeting an oil rig  albeit one said by the Pentagon to have been turned into a military command post  Washington also sent a message that it might be willing to attack Irans economic lifeline Pentagon officials said the platform had been used as a base for Iranian raids against shipping in the lower Gulf     We have chosen a military target but we also have shown Iran that we are willing to interfere with its oilexporting capabilities Cordesman said     He predicted the United States would respond to any future major Iranian challenges by hitting Irans naval base at Bandar Abbas on the Straits of Hormuz followed by mining the approaches to Irans oil export terminal on Kharg Island     Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger said on Monday the United States did not seek further confrontation with Iran but we will be prepared to meet any escalation of military action by Iran with stronger countermeasures   Reuter 3
