2  TOKYO DEALERS SEE DOLLAR POISED TO BREACH 140 YEN       By Rie Sagawa       TOKYO Oct 19    Tokyos foreign exchange market is watching nervously to see if the US Dollar will drop below the significant 14000 yen level dealers said     The 140 yen level is key for the dollar because it is considered to be the lower end of the reference range If the currency breaks through this level it may decline sharply said Hirozumi Tanaka assistant general manager at Daiichi Kangyo Bank Ltds international treasury division     The dollar was at 14110 yen at midday against Friday closes of 1423545 in New York and 14135 here     The dollar opened at 14095 yen and fell to a low of 14040 It was 1773338 marks against 1797585 in New York and 1800813 here on Friday after an opening 1770010     The currencys decline was due to remarks on Sunday by US Treasury Secretary James Baker dealers said     The dollar fell over the weekend on increased bearish sentiment after Bakers comments said Daiichis Tanaka He said this stemmed from mounting concern that cooperation among the group of seven G7 industrial nations to implement the Louvre accord to stabilise currencies might be fraying     The dollars fall was also prompted by a record oneday drop in the Dow Jones industrial average on Friday and weakness in US Bond prices dealers said     Baker said the Louvre accord was still operative but he strongly criticised West German moves to raise key interest rates Operators took Bakers comment to indicate impatience with some G7 members for failing to stick to the Louvre accord due to their fears of increasing inflation     Rises in interest rates aimed at dampening inflationary pressures also slow domestic demand     West Germany and Japan had both pledged at G7 meetings to boost domestic demand to help narrow the huge US Trade deficit Tanaka said     US August trade data showed the US Deficit at a still massive 1568 billion dlrs But if West Germany raises interest rates this would run counter to the pledge he said     Operators are now waiting to see if the G7 nations coordinate dollar buying intervention said Soichi Hirabayashi deputy general manager of Fuju Bank Ltds foreign exchange department     The target range set by the Louvre accord is generally considered to be 14000 to 16000 yen dealers said     The market is likely to try the 140 yen level in the near future and at that time if operators see the G7 nations failing to coordinate intervention they would see the Louvre accord as abandoned and push the dollar down aggressively Hirabayashi said He said the US Currency could fall as low as 135 yen soon  REUTER 3
