2  TOYOTA ltTOYOT SEES LOWER US SALES IN 1988       DETROIT Oct 20    Toyota Motor Co expects its US vehicle sales in 1988 will decline to about 875000 cars and trucks from roughly 930000 expected in 1987 a senior exeuctive said     Jim Perkins group vice president for sales and marketing for Toyotas US sales subsidiary told reporters Toyotas expected decline will come principally in the truck segment where the company faces intense competition from US domestic manufacturers such as Ford Motor Co ltF     Toyota he said also expects to stress sales in the low and middle segments of the car market to remain competitive     Asked if Toyotas US profits could show a substantial decline with its lower trucks sales in the next two years he responded conceivably it could but added Our plan is not to chase this thing to where it makes no economic sense     Perkins also predicted that the 1988 US vehicle market could fall below 15 mln sales from above 15 mln expected this year He expects some smaller Japanese automakers could be forced to withdraw from the US market or to seek partnerships with one another in the face of intense competition      The Toyota executive said the collapse of US stock prices and any further weakening of the dollar would likely have a very quick impact on the Japanese car companies     In our company when the stock market goes down we see it very soon in the New York metropolitan car market New York is the best indicator of whats going to happen in the rest of of the country I can tell you from the next 15 days of car sales in the New York market what it will be in the rest of the country in the next six months Perkins said      The Toyota executive said the panic selloff in the New York Stock Exchange hurts the car market because it does create a shock wave of doubt in the minds of consumers      He said Toyota would wait at least 30 to 60 days to assess the impact of the the stock market drop on the wider economy before making any changes in its basic business plan for the US market     Toyota he said expects its 1988 US sales will total at least 600000 cars and 275000 trucks compared with about 630000 cars and 300000 trucks expected for 1987 and 644000 cars and 388000 trucks sold in 1986     He said Toyota hopes it will be able to import 610000 cars from Japan in 1988 the same as its 1987 allocation under Tokyos voluntary export restraint scheme     But he said it was uncertain if Toyota would keep its current allocation becuase of pressures on Japans Ministry of International Trade and Industry to roll back Japanese car export quotas from the current 23 mln annualized rate  Reuter 3
