2  WILL WORLD RECESSION FOLLOW STOCK MARKET PLUNGE       By Linda Sieg       TOKYO Oct 20    Some economists fear a world recession if stock exchanges continue to plunge Others are more sanguine     The pessimists say the stocks shakeout is destroying personal assets and dampening consumption     The real economic effects can be significant  the destruction of wealth and a deflationary impact on the economy said an economist at a US Securities house     But other economists said such fears were overblown     Because of lower appreciation of corporate or personal assets that much negative impact could be observed in the US said Keikichi Honda general manager of economic research at the Bank of Tokyo Ltd     But the appreciation of stock prices has not been playing such a major role in the entire US Gross national product GNP Honda said     The pessimists noted that the record fall on Wall Street on Monday was sparked by fears the US Economy is heading for a recession or serious slowdown much earlier than expected     But the optimists said a dampening effect on consumption due to stock market losses was less likely in Japan     In Japan the weight of stocks in individuals total assets is less than in the US And the total weight of individuals holdings in the stock market is less so there will be less damage than in the US said an economist at one of Japans major brokerage houses     Japan is taking strong measures to stimulate domestic demand so while there could be some impact from the reduction of assets value it would not be a major impact said the Bank of Tokyos Honda     Optimists also pointed to incipient declines in US Interest rates as a positive sign for the US Economy     US Interest rates are coming down so there is a feeling that interest rates have hit their ceiling and the US Economy is strong so there should be no direct impact from the collapse of share prices said Toshiaki Kakimoto Sumitomo Bank Ltd chief economist     Some economists suggested that should markets continue to slump the major industrial nations may have to discuss possible joint lowering of official discount rates     Until last week a discussion of lower rates was unthinkable now its not said the Japanese brokerage house economist     There has been a move from the purely rational to the emotional  its a central bankers nightmare said the foreign economist It will require strong global leadership by politicians to snuff out he said     However previously the stocks correction was due to fears of higher interest rates a possible resurgence of inflation and the depreciation of the dollar said Nobuyuki Ueda senior economist at the LongTerm Credit Bank Ltd     Now some people have an uneasy feeling about the outlook of the US Economy Ueda said     If the stock market is a leading indicator of the future movement of the economy this decline will have very significant implications for the US Economy he said     If the low levels hold those who were keeping consumption high because of unrealised gains could curb consumption said Salomon Brothers Asia Ltd economist Ron Napier If the paper gains arent there people wont spend     A US Recession could then trigger similar declines in other economies some economists said     I dont know if a possible recession in the US Would trigger a world recession because other nations such as Japan are showing good economic performance LTCBs Ueda said But we cant rule out the possibility because the US Is still playing a very dominant role in the world economy  REUTER 3
