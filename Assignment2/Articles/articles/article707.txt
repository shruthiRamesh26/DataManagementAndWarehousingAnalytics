2  US TROPICAL OIL LABELING PLAN SUFFERS DEFEAT       WASHINGTON Oct 19    A proposal to require imported tropical oils to be labeled as saturated fats suffered a narrow and possibly debilitating defeat in the US Senate     The Senate Agriculture Committee rejected the proposal by a 108 vote virtually snuffing out US soybean producers hopes the plan would be adopted this year     A similar proposal has made no headway in the House     Sen Tom Harkin DIowa offered the proposal as an amendment to a farm spending reduction package     I dont see this as a trade issue I see it as giving American consumers the information they need he said     Proponents of the measure including the American Soybean Association have claimed palm palm kernel and coconut oils are high in saturated fat and can contribute to heart disease     The US soybean industry believes labels indicating tropical oils are high in saturated fats would discourage consumption of the oils imported primarily from Malaysia Indonesia and the Philippines     But Sen Richard Lugar RInd read a letter from US Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter who said the proposal blatantly discriminates against imports would be impossible to defend under international trade law and would harm relations with the Philippines Malaysia and Indonesia     Yeutters letter also said Americans derive most of their saturated fats from meat and dairy products and relatively little from tropical oils     The committee voted largely along party lines with three Democrats joining seven Republicans to oppose the measure  Reuter 3
