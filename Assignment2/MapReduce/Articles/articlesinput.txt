 european community ec agriculture ministers gave their support in principle for a new scheme to limit spending on the blocs controversial farm policy at a meeting in luxembourg on tuesday danish minister laurits tornaes told journalists     acceptance of the scheme by which farmers would suffer price cuts if their production exceeded certain norms known in ec jargon as stabilisers is seen by diplomats as vital if the ec is to solve its current massive budget crisis     speaking at a news conference after chairing a twoday meeting of farm ministers tornaes said it is no longer a question of whether we are to have stabilisers it is now a question of how we are to implement them     however ec sources warned that despite tornaes optimism it may be difficult to get the sort of detailed agreement needed on the stabiliser scheme ahead of an ec heads of government meeting in copenhagen on december 6     this is the vital meeting at which ec leaders will be asked to agree a new system of ec financing ending the blocs handtomouth existence which has resulted in its being unable to agree a budget for 1988     britain has said it will block moves to give the ec additional sources of finance unless a detailed system of stabilisers is agreed at or ahead of the summit     under the most important stabiliser scheme ec guaranteed prices for cereals would be cut by one percentage point for every per cent by which the annual harvest exceeded 155 mln tonnes a figure well below what ec farmers are capable of producing in a year of favourable weather conditions    farm ministers will meet again on november 16 to attempt to hammer out an accord and danish diplomatic sources said the meeting could last through several long nights of negotiation     but tornaes said any thought that success was not ultimately possible would be a gesture of retreat at this stage     ec commission sources said among the remaining problems were appeals from southern member states for protection for their small and relatively poor farmers and calls from france and the netherlands for significant changes to commission proposals for arable crops     they added that west germany appears still reluctant to accept the idea of production ceilings being set at the level of the ec as a whole rather than that of member states     meanwhile the ministers made little progress in agreeing a scheme to top up the income of poorer farmers through direct payments which could help to cushion the impact of stabilisers on them     british minister john macgregor told journalists the proposals as they stand have very few friends     he said a number of countries fear they could simply encourage further unwanted production by giving farmers the cash to improve production methods  reuter 3 2

despite the selloff in world stock markets petersen said the underlying fundamentals in the private sector of the us economy remain strong so calendar 1988 vehicle sales should equal the 1987 total

stating the dollar is still too strong relative to other major currencies     for example he said the dollar should be about 120 yen currently instead of its present level just below 144 yen

fixedincome markets but underwriters said they doubt company treasurers will rush to borrow before rates increase further     corporate treasurers will continue to issue new debt when they believe they are borrowing at an attractive rate said an underwriter with a major wall street house     said another we will not see a flood of new offerings treasurers are reassessing the market we will not see new issuance dry up either     still the pace of corporate borrowing in the public finance market has slowed according to a reuter tabulation     last week which was shortened by the columbus day holiday saw issuance of 13 billion dlrs of new debt that was down from the prior weeks tally of slightly more than two billion dlrs of new debt     in contrast a year ago it was not unusual to see those amounts of new offerings in a single day as companies took advantage of the then decline in interest rates to refinance old highercost debt or to expand operations via financings at low attractive rates underwriters noted     companies will conduct financings that they believe are essential said an underwriter with a mediumsized wall street firm but we will not see much more than that until the market stabilizes     in the meantime treasurers will probably prefer shorter term issues analysts said for instance of last weeks nine issues only one had a maturity of more than 10 years     the other offerings had maturities of two to seven years with most clustered in the two to three year area according to a reuter tabulation that is because singledigit interest rates were had last week only among twoyear securities     if people think that interest rates will continue to head higher then we could see treasurers rushing to market said a trader with a mediumsized securities house     but if people think last weeks sharp interest rate rise is a fluke treasurers will sit back and wait for rates to decline before issuing new debt hoping of course that they are not missing the boat by doing so she added     another impediment to new issuance is the lukewarm reception to new issues by institutional and retail investors in recent weeks traders pointed out many investors refrained from buying because they believed rate would rise further     we saw a lot of buying interest last week but people are not yet willing to pull the trigger a broker said they would rather wait and see if the recent rate increase can be sustained     conflicting forecasts on the likely direction of interest rates did not help analysts said for instance henry kaufman chief economist with salomon brothers inc said in his weekly comments on credit that the yields of us treasury bonds would probably rise further because the marketplace expects inflation to rise and the dollar to continue to decline     in contrast standard and poors corp said on friday that prices of debt securities in the fixedincome markets would recover the rating agency said neither the economy nor the dollar justify current high yields     meanwhile the chicago board of trade is slated to hold a press briefing on tuesday in new york about its plans to list a futures contract based on a

branko mikulic on monday proposed new taxes hitting high income earners moonlighters property and interest on savings as part of new government plans to rein in the countrys 123 pct inflation     he also proposed price and wage restraint and the trimming of repayments on the 20 billion dlr foreign debt in line with currency earning abiltiy     the taxes will anger many yugoslavs struggling with soaring prices and will be resisted in parliament a western diplomatic source said yugoslav economists said mikulics draft plans left many questions unanswered     it was a list of goals not concrete measures said a senior yugoslav economist at a leading yugoslav research institute     the state news agency tanjug was more optimistic it said the proposals indicated real economic reforms were coming     further details of the program which mikulic summarised in parliament are to appear in the days ahead and the draft has to be debated and voted on by deputies in november     the goals are good a leading belgrade economist said no one can argue with that but the million dollar question as with all government programs here is how they will be implemented     zoran popov senior research fellow at the belgrade institute for industrial economy said the existing system made many of the proposals difficult to put into effect     a change in the the system of taxation requires changes in the constitution he said mikulics speech tells us what he wants to do but not how     it may be antiinflationary one diplomat said but the question is how can you tax a black economy and how will the government find out who has two jobs or more than one home     economists and diplomats said the proposals could be resisted by deputies from several of yugoslavias constituent republics and provinces in defence of regional interests     such resistance has blocked the nationwide implementation of federal government economic policy on many past occasions  reuter 3 2  cityfed financial corp ltctyfo

44 billion stg surge in uk september sterling bank lending is unlikely to nudge the bank of england towards tightening monetary policy as long as sterling remains in its present robust state economists said     an acute crisis of confidence in equity markets over the past two days will in any case subdue personal consumer credit demand which has largely been behind growth in lending     in the normal course of events the markets would have been extremely worried about that figure noted peter spencer uk economist with credit suisse first boston     after an initial dip in reaction to the bank lending data which compared won stg august rise uk government bonds gilts soared as investors continued to flee from plummetting equities into the relative security of government securities     equity markets dropped sharply on the news touching a days low of 17667 on the ftse 100 index after the data before staging a recovery sterling held its buoyant tone throughout     uk money market rates in a similarly calm response resumed the slightly easier trend of earlier in the morning after little more than a token blip as the figures came out     noting that such a huge rise in credit extended by banks would under other circumstances have prompted market fears of a rise in clearing bank base rates from the current 10 pct with the financial markets doing what theyre doing thats the last thing the bank of england would want to do spencer said     the monetary situation is clearly very bad but as long as sterling is firm the authorities are unlikely to put rates up said kevin boakes chief uk economist at greenwell montagu gilt edged boakes pointed to a rise in the narrow money measure m0 to 52 pct yearonyear from augusts 45 pct growth which he said must cause some concern at the treasury     but the fact that overall broad money growth has slowed down is a rather encouraging sign noted paul temperton uk economist with merrill lynch capital markets he pointed to a fall in the yearonyear growth rate of the m3 broad money aggregate to 195 pct in september from augusts 22 pct     it was concern about credit growth which prompted the bank of england to engineer a one point rise in uk bank base rates to 10 pct in early august caution endorsed subsequently by news of a massive 49 billion stg july rise in bank lending     temperton noted that a particular focus of

our offer a bank of new york spokesman said     irving would not comment on how the drop in the market affects its position on the bid or whether it would buy back any of its own shares     earlier this month irving rejected the bid as inadequate and said it wanted to retain its independence     in late september bank of new york offered 80 dlrs per share in cash for 474 pct of irving for the

however industry sources were more uncertain about prospects for the deal     with irvings price so low bank of new yorks offer will look good to irving shareholders said michael flores a consultant at bank earnings international a consulting firm     the drop of irvings share to 44 dlrs per share which is about a 26 dlr drop from the beginning of last week increases the chance that bank of new york will succeed flores said     analysts said that the drop in bank stock prices is likely to depress the level of mergers and acquisition in the banking industry     bank takeovers are less likely because banks cant use their own stock to make acquisitions because their share price is too depressed alpert said     since only banks can buy another bank the only other possible acquirors would be

analysts predict diet carbonated soft drinks will hold about 28 pct of the soda market by years end up from 25 pct in 1986     that market coupled with increased usage of nutrasweet in such items as

below the significant 14000 yen level dealers said     the 140 yen level is key for the dollar because it is considered to be the lower end of the reference range if the currency breaks through this level it may decline sharply said hirozumi tanaka assistant general manager at daiichi kangyo bank ltds international treasury division     the dollar was at 14110 yen at midday against friday closes of 1423545 in new york and 14135 here     the dollar opened at 14095 yen and fell to a low of 14040 it was 1773338 marks against 1797585 in new york and 1800813 here on friday after an opening 1770010     the currencys decline was due to remarks on sunday by us treasury secretary james baker dealers said     the dollar fell over the weekend on increased bearish sentiment after bakers comments said daiichis tanaka he said this stemmed from mounting concern that cooperation among the group of seven g7 industrial nations to implement the louvre accord to stabilise currencies might be fraying     the dollars fall was also prompted by a record oneday drop in the dow jones industrial average on friday and weakness in us bond prices dealers said     baker said the louvre accord was still operative but he strongly criticised west german moves to raise key interest rates operators took bakers comment to indicate impatience with some g7 members for failing to stick to the louvre accord due to their fears of increasing inflation     rises in interest rates aimed at dampening inflationary pressures also slow domestic demand     west germany and japan had both pledged at g7 meetings to boost domestic demand to help narrow the huge us trade deficit tanaka said     us august trade data showed the us deficit at a still massive 1568 billion dlrs but if west germany raises interest rates this would run counter to the pledge he said     operators are now waiting to see if the g7 nations coordinate dollar buying intervention said soichi hirabayashi deputy general manager of fuju bank ltds foreign exchange department     the target range set by the louvre accord is generally considered to be 14000 to 16000 yen dealers said     the market is likely to try the 140 yen level in the near future and at that time if operators see the g7 nations failing to coordinate intervention they would see the louvre accord as abandoned and push the dollar down aggressively hirabayashi said he

saudi to remain as key lpg supplier to japan       by masaru sato       tokyo oct 19    saudi arabia is likely to remain the key supplier of liquefied petroleum gas lpg to japan for at least the next five years oil industry sources said     japan while diversifying its supply sources of propane and butane for stable supplies will continue to bank on saudi arabian lpg the sources said     they said saudis supply capabilities of lpg an associate of crude oil is guaranteed by its crude output capacity saudi is a reliable supplier in that sense said one trader     japan imports about 50 pct of its lpg from saudi arabia     no single nation could substitute for saudi arabia as an lpg supply source to japan the sources said     saudi arabia has committed itself to japanese lpg buyers which has quelled fears that lpg supplies from the mideast gulf could easily be disrupted in the wake of heightened hostilities in that area said another trader     saudi arabia cut lpg shipments to japan and elsewhere by 20 pct in september after a fire put a major gas plant at aljuaimah out of operation october shipments were back to contractual volumes as saudi was able to boost exports from other ports     attacks on gulf shipping by iran and iraq centered on crude rather than products carriers which has lulled fears of lpg supply disruptions traders said     they said an iranian blockade of the strait of hormuz was unlikely because it would block irans oil shipments     industry sources said japans lpg imports will not greatly rise or fall as its domestic demand growth is estimated at a moderate 21 pct a year from 1986 through 1991     japanese term buyers of saudi lpg are expected to lift slightly lower volumes from january 1987 when imports from indonesia are slated to increase the sources said     the customers are unlikely to slash saudi term purchases in large scale when japan increases annual imports of indonesian lpg to 195 mln tonnes in early 1989 from 319000 tonnes in the year ended march 1987 the sources said     but when demand is sluggish in summer they will phase down term purchases of saudi lpg and secure lowerpriced cargoes on the spot market they said     japan imports some 12 mln tonnes of lpg a year of which 53 mln tonnes are supplied by saudi arabia 33 mln under term contracts and two mln through spot purchases some 80 pct of japans lpg imports are from the middle east     saudi arabias state owned oil company petromin has made some concessions on term prices to japanese customers in the recent round of contract renewal talks and it is likely the japanese will accept the offer the sources said     the japanese term customers however have so far been unsuccessful in establishing a transparent price formula to replace the existing unilateral monthly price notice     japanese buyers pay saudi arabia a price notified by petromin each month most recently the fob price was set at 87 pct of the 1752 dlrs per barrel government selling price gsp of arabian light     buyers reserve the right to phase down or out liftings should the monthly price be set at over 95 pct of arabian lights gsp     petromin has offered to lower this rate to 90 pct from the 95 pct for contracts with japanese customers from next january the trade sources said     petromin also suggested that a sellers option of supplying up to 20 pct more than the contractural volume be subject to sellerbuyer agreement     under the present contract petromin can automatically cut supplies up to 10 pct of the contractual volume     if you want to import lpg from saudi arabia on a profitable basis you have to set the price factor at 80 to 85 pct said an official at a major importer freight costs are higher for cargoes coming from the gulf than southeast asia due to a longer haul and war risk insurance payments     japanese customers will visit saudi arabia this month to finalise their separate contract talks now focusing on contractual period and volume which could be very similar to current levels the sources said when we talk business we would seek profitability and sometimes forget vulnerability of high dependence on a single supplier said one  reuter 3

intense competition from us domestic manufacturers such as ford motor co ltf     toyota he said also expects to stress sales in the low and middle segments of the car market to remain competitive     asked if toyotas us profits could show a substantial decline with its lower trucks sales in the next two years he responded conceivably it could but added our plan is not to chase this thing to where it makes no economic sense     perkins also predicted that the 1988 us vehicle market could fall below 15 mln sales from above 15 mln expected this year he expects some smaller japanese automakers could be forced to withdraw from the us market or to seek partnerships with one another in the face of intense competition      the toyota executive said the collapse of us stock prices and any

minds of consumers      he said toyota would wait at least 30 to 60 days to assess the impact of the the stock market drop on the wider economy before making any changes in its basic business plan for the us market     toyota he said expects its 1988 us sales will total at least 600000 cars and 275000 trucks compared with about 630000 cars and 300000 trucks expected for 1987 and 644000 cars and 388000 trucks sold in 1986     he said toyota hopes it will be able to import 610000 cars from japan in 1988 the same as its 1987 allocation under tokyos voluntary export restraint scheme     but he said it was uncertain if toyota would keep its current allocation becuase of pressures on japans ministry of international trade and industry to roll back japanese car export quotas from the current

devaluation of assets of which we are all concerned he said     speaking to reporters phelan listed several reasons why the market fell today he said stocks have been going up for five years without a correction he also blamed inflation fears rising interest rates a lower dollar and problems with iran all came together in a very nervous market he said     its the nearest thing to a meltdown that i ever want to see phelan said phelan said what he meant by meltdown was a snowballing effect where selling fed on itself     phelan said the nyse is going through its standard procedures before trading begins tomorrow those procedures include checking with member firms on their liquidity margin positions and backlog we know of no firm that has a significant problem but that could change at any moment he said     asked for advice for the average investor phelan said we do not know where the market will end up     the dow jones industrial average declined a record 508 points to 173874 volume

economy he added that the underlying fundamentals of the us economy are still strong and that corporate earnings also continue to be firm     phelan explained todays record descent as being the result of a confluence of factors including the globalization of markets and the proliferation of new securities instruments     those two factors alone have made the market more volatile he said     phelan also said a major factor in the decline was the fact that there has been no major correction in the fiveyear bull market he also pointed to rising tension in the mideast gulf     the new york stock exchange was in constant contact with the securities and exchange commission about a possible halt in all trading on the exchange phelan said the consensus was that it is better to let the market try to work itself out he said     in addition phelan said that with the global nature of trading there is no guarantee that halting trading on the new york stock exchange would have served any purpose

ec oilseed policies as illegal under the general agreement on tariffs and trade and threatened to make an unfair trade complaint if the ec does not remedy the situation     asa vice president james adams told an asasponsored outlook 87 conference it will be filed unless the ec takes drastic and immediate steps     these subsidies are blatantly unfair and are gatt illegal since they were established after the zero soybean duty was established in 1962 he said     the asas unfair trade petition against the ec would ask for an investigation and modification of ec oilseed policies to make the regime nondiscriminatory     the ec in 1962 ruled all ec oilseed imports dutyfree in an effort to fill its oilseed needs but ec oilseeds production has risen dramatically since then     the ec now guarantees oilseed prices to farmers above world market levels and is considering implementing a controversial oils and fats tax     the subsidies are obvious attempts to circumvent the zero duty binding and that makes us farmers mad as hell adams said     the asa is confident the us congress will support its trade complaint adams said the asa also strongly opposes an ec proposal to tax vegetable and marine oils consumed in the ec which will be considered by the ec commission in december     us soybean world market share has declined 35 pct in volume and 40 pct in value since 1982

computers systems have been strained by the avalanche of trading triggered by the past weeks stock market collapse     and while the financial instrys hitech resources have been able to handle the crisis the sudden surge in trading volume will likely force the exchanges and securities firms to revamp their computer systems and communications networks several years earlier than they had planned industry officials said     we had already started certain processes to increase the new york stock exchanges capacity said jim squyres a spokesman for the securities industry automation corp which runs the central computer network for the new york and american stock exchanges     we will have to seriously consider speeding that up he said after three straight days of record volume however many exchanges were pushing their systems to untested limits and while the exchanges said their computers were handling the crush brokers and traders complained about lost trades and delayed price quotes     the most serious problems arose on monday when a record fall of 508 points in the dow and volume of more than 600 mln shares on the new york stock exchange stunned the entire industry     the american stock exchanges orderrouting system crashed just 10 minutes before trading closed the pacific stock exchange suspended business a halfhour early so it could catch up with a massive backlog of trades     and the pricequote feed supplied by the nyse was cut off several times during the day leaving some traders with quotes that were often 45 minutes behind the actual market      although the computers whirred away late into the night the exchanges opened on time tuesday and problems were fewer even though nyse volume swelled to 610 mln shares combined volume of the nyse american and overthecounter exchanges topped 900 mln shares     i think were equipped for this kind of trading said paul stevens executive vice president of operations for the american stock exchange     the problem is less the computers which are handling the volume than the strain on people he said          the computers might turn out to be the heroes of this whole thing added duwayne peterson executive vice president of technology at merrill lynch and co inc     in fact officials said the biggest constraint on trading was caused by some of the oldest machines on exchange floors the card printers that issue the buy and sell orders     but even as computer executives spoke with awe about their systems ability to hold up under unprecedented pressure they started to plan for the future       we had to do a lot of innovative things to handle this volume said squyres of the securities industry automation corp siac which is jointly owned by the new york and american stock exchanges     siac had planned to boost the capacity of its system by up to 50 pct by 1990 but that and other improvements will now be made much earlier     meanwhile new york telephone co said mondays panic

social laws written during the great depression should prevent a repeat of that dismal era more protection still might have to be considered         and analysts caution that while new laws can deal

which is the dollar and trade deficits     schultze now with the brookings institution thinktank pointed to a weak federal reserve during the 1920s when the fed acted in the wrong way in 1929it

destroyers attacked the platform about 120 miles east of bahrain in the central gulf with fire at 0700 edt weinberger said     we chose a platform used by the iranians to interfere with and be a source of potential attack on convoys weinberger said at a pentagon briefing      we know it has been used indeed to not only launch small boat attacks on shipping but to fire on us helicopters     its removal will contribute significantly to the safety of us forces in the future weinberger said of the us navys operation to escort oil tankers through the gulf     we do not seek further confrontation with iran but we will be prepared to meet any escalation of military actions by iran with stronger countermeasures weinberger said     he said the 20 to 30 iranian personnel on the oil platform were given a 20minute warning to abandon the platform     as far as we know they did abandon the site he said     weinberger was asked why the united states had chosen to attack an oil

government of muchneeded revenue to spur japans economy and may hurt banks ability to lend abroad analysts polled by reuters said     the japanese government is depending on the sale of ntt nippon telegraph and telephone corp ltncctt shares for much of its public spending budget said shigeo suzuki a deputy general manager at the industrial bank of japan     japan had hoped to raise at least 5000 billion yen from the sale of 195 mln ntt shares on november 10     however the 149 pct plunge in the tokyo share index today has made such plans look unrealistic analysts said     the government could defer the sale of ntt or they could offer fewer shares said keikichi honda general manager of economic research at the bank of tokyo ltd     honda said another possibility is that the underwriters handling the ntt sale would have to pay the government the amount it expected to get and bear the brunt of any losses themselves that is what underwriting means he added     a finance ministry official confirmed that the government planned to go ahead with its sale of ntt shares on november 10     another possible effect of tokyos stock tumble would be to seriously undermine the asset base of japanese banks     the banks lend money all over the world and regard the market value of stock holdings as assets analysts said     japanese banks make loans using perhaps as much as 60 to 70 pct of the market value of their unrealised stock holdings as assets said industrial banks suzuki     there is also concern that japanese companies which have invested heavily in tokyos stocks as their real business declined over the last two years have sustained heavy losses     many companies mainly exportoriented companies were planning on selling their shares for a profit to reinvest in real businesses as the economy begins to pick up said one analyst at a foreign brokerage that prospect now looks dim     but analysts said it is unlikely companies or financial institutions will be bankrupted by losses in stock trading     i dont think any company is so badly exposed in stock investments said a senior analyst at nomura research institute in terms of financial institutions luckily the rebounding bond market and currency markets are still profitable he added     the nomura analyst said a 10 pct decline in tokyo stocks would be translated into a fall of about 02 pct in consumer spending some 20 pct of tokyo stocks are owned by individuals     market capitalisation on the tokyo stock exchange fell to 329588 billion yen on tuesday from 386041 billion at mondays close

louvre accord cannot cure the fundamental problems bedevilling the world economy which lie behind the current collapse in stock markets london economists said     theres going to have to be some acknowledgement that the dollar is going to be allowed to slip said richard jeffrey of hoare govett if not there is going to be continued fear that when pressure emerges on the dollar the fed will be forced to tighten this throws up the economic abyss of recession in the us with obvious knock on effects on the rest of the world     but some economists added that wall streets crash which dragged other major markets down with it may help curb the very problems that sparked the turmoil  namely world inflation fears and the massive and persistent us trade deficits     if there is a benefit from a 23 pct fall in wall street its some sort of resistance to inflation worldwide said geoffrey dennis of brokers james capel echoing comments from other london and tokyo analysts     lower personal wealth from lower stock prices and fears of further falls should dampen credit growth curbing inflationary pressures and import demand in the us they say     such considerations may be helping bond markets resist the equity crash according to mike osborne of kleinwort grieveson     it would be suicidal for any government in the context of what happened in the last couple of days to jack up their interest rates he added     stocks surged after news chemical bank cut its prime lending rate half a point to 925 pct tuesday and us fed chairman alan greenspan pledged support for the financial system     the news eroded the most immediate fears that the stock collapse would spill over into the economy via a banking crisis for example thus precipitating recession     it also helped the dollar rally sharply to a high of 18200 marks from a european low of 17880 but economists said todays whiplash moves do not have long term significance and that markets should try to keep the underlying fundamentals in mind     the united states has been able to live on borrowed time if the effect of this crash is to produce slower economic growth not recessionit contains good news and provides a more realistic assessment of the us economy said capels dennis but he added that markets are still very much in danger     the liquidity doesnt disappearall its doing is disappearing from the equity markets dennis noted     david morrison of goldman sachs international said world market turbulence will be exacerbated if the group of seven g7 leading western nations confirms a base for the dollar as implied by west german finance minister gerhard stoltenbergs remarks that intervention to support currencies is still on     last weeks dollar fall was partly triggered by expectations that the germans were more worried about the money supply impact of such intervention than maintaining currency stability     but rigid adherence to dollar ranges would be bad said morrison the louvre

transatlantic row imperils louvre accorddealers       by guy collins       paris oct 19    the louvre accord on currency stability which has maintained an uneasy calm in currency markets since last february appeared in serious danger today as a transatlantic dispute over west german interest rates came to the boil foreign exchange dealers said     but as the dollar slid against the mark and world stock and bond markets plunged officials in the major industrial countries played down the dispute as a bilateral problem between the united states and west germany and insisted that the currency pact was still alive     us treasury secretary james baker sparked the market fears when he attacked the rise in west german shortterm interest rates thats not in keeping with the spirit of what we agreed to as recently as earlier this month in washington baker said in a us television interview on sunday he was referring to the meetings of finance ministers from the group of seven g7 leading industrial nations which reaffirmed the pact     under the louvre accord west germany and japan who both have large trade surpluses pledged to boost their economic growth to take in more exports from the us while the us agreed to stop talking the dollar down     however baker said on saturday that while the louvre agreement was still operative the west german interest rate move would force the us to reexamine the accord     the foreign exchange market has been told by baker that hes going to hammer germany  he has just declared all bets are off in terms of currency cooperation chris johns currency analyst at ubsphillips and drew in london said     but a bank of japan official took a much more sanguine view telling reuters that the exchange market is apparently reacting too much and anyone who sold the dollar on the baker comment will regret it later on     french finance minister edouard balladur who hosted the louvre meeting was the only one of the g7 finance ministers to respond directly to bakers remarks he called for a faithful and firm adherence by all the major industrial countries to the louvre accords  in both their letter and spirit     neither the west german finance ministry nor the british treasury commented on the row     but a japanese finance ministry official said that despite us frustration over higher interest rates abroad this does not represent its readiness to scrap the basic framework of the louvre accord     in frankfurt f wilhelm christians joint chief executive of west germanys largest bank deutsche bank said that following recent meetings with baker he believed that the us was still committed to the accord     in a move which the market interpreted as a possible gesture of reconciliation the bundesbank added shortterm

the psycological effect the market will tend to stabilize itself somoza said     somoza said he based his optimism on the relatively bright outlook of the mexican economy due to increased income from

and 899 mln a year earlier     exports in october could be relatively modest due to many public holidays but by the end of this year the surplus will be well over nine billion dollars close to ten

precarious       by donald nordberg and michael shields       zurich oct 19    todays sharp selloff of swiss stocks and matching falls around europe may have been overdone but the mood on financial markets is precarious swiss securities analysts and economists said     panic selling took swiss shares down six pct at the opening on enormous volume triggered by the slide on wall street and the threat of renewed currency instability     i have never experienced anything like this and ive been in the business for 20 years said bernhard wyttenbach head of european research at union bank of switzerland     the analysts blamed the selloff in europe on us monetary authorities this weekend us treasury secretary james baker publicly voiced his displeasure with west german monetary policy he said the eightmonthold louvre accord to stabilise currencies was still working but added on the other hand we will not sit back and watch surplus countries jack up interest rates and squeeze growth on the expectation that the united states will raise rates     hans peter ast of societe generale alsacienne sogenal in zurich said the situation is very dangerous statements by the us authorities have fuelled anxiety about interest rates     herbert fritschi director of zurich cantonal banks financial research department called the selloff overdone but warned that the situation could worsen unless central banks loosen their monetary policy     i think the trend toward higher interest rates is over he said the federal reserve and the bundesbank have to step in with an easy money policy or else there is going to be an economic catastrophe they have to act quickly     wyttenbach said the black monday selloff was clearly exaggerated with swiss reinsurance co participation certificates falling 20 pct in value at one point     but wyttenbach said he did not believe that a correction would come soon first the bad news will reach small investors only in time for tomorrows market when there could be another smaller selling wave     as soon as the dollar stabilises  and thats the key  then well get a strong movement upward wyttenbach said but that may not come soon     people are simply worried that in america where the market has now fallen by 18 pct since august the bull market is over he said people are afraid that well have a recession in 1988     baker was wrong to blame the west germans for the current problems and the weak dollar wyttenbach said we do not have a mark problem we have a dollar problem he added but said the biggest culprit was the new chairman of the us federal reserve board alan greenspan     wyttenbach recalled that greenspan had suggested that the dollar might be too high in the medium term and that interest rates might have to rise as a central banker he shouldnt do that wyttenbach said there is a danger that we will fall back into the 1970s he said we have a real crisis of confidence in greenspan i would much rather have a volcker     paul volcker retired as fed chairman on august 11     cantonal banks fritschi said im relatively optimistic because the situation looks too bad the fed certainly has to intervene     he said he did not expect the swiss national bank to take any significant steps adding that the focus of attention remains on the united states     the panic started in new york it has to end there     the cantonal bank

jakarta oct 20    indonesia told the oil industry on tuesday it will extend contracts on producing blocks and improve the investment climate but wants to see increased expenditure on exploration in return     president suharto in an opening speech to the indonesian petroleum association said indonesia was ready to extend contracts held by foreign oil companies on producing areas     in order to boost investment in the petroleum industry the government of indonesia has basically approved of extending production sharing contracts under the present laws suharto said     apart from that the government will keep improving the investment climate in order to accelerate the development of the petroleum industry he said     indonesian energy minister subroto told the association he was aware that the oil industry needed to be assured that contracts on blocks expiring within the next 10 years would be renewed before they would invest in further exploration     as we all have heard this morning the president is fully aware of this situation subroto said     the government has already made the political decision to entertain this time problem by inviting the existing producers to continue their activities in indonesia albeit on a selective basis     indonesia one of the 13 members of opec must find new oil reserves if it is to remain an exporter in the next decade oil industry sources say     subroto said the government was also working to ease other problems including granting easier terms for remote areas or deep water conditions     but subroto said relations with oil companies were twoway and that they should step up expenditure on oil exploration now that the oil price had recovered     president suharto said he wanted to see greater transfer of technology to indonesian companies and more help from the oil industry for the regions in which companies operated     abdul rachman ramly the president of state oil company pertamina has said that budgeted exploration and production expenditure for all oil companies in indonesia was forecast to fall to 31 billion dlrs in calendar 1987 from 34 billion in 1986     pertamina has 69 productionsharing or joint operation contracts with foreign oil companies     subroto said speeding up necessary approvals for field operations was a government priority there had been misunderstandings between the government and the oil industry in certain areas such as when a field is designated commercial and a thorough evaluation was being made     he said the government wanted to finalise contract extensions as soon as practical and urged the industry in the meantime to maintain its exploration drive     subroto said indonesia needed the companies to maintain exploration efforts even if their contract was due to expire within 10 years this need in itself is some sort of guarantee that we will soon have to come up with an extension agreement     eleven major contract areas are due to come up for renewal between 1991 and 2001 industry sources said     extension of the contracts on the blocks has involved detailed negotiations but so far no extension has been granted     subroto told reporters afterwards that contract extensions would be selective based on how much capital would be invested  reuter 3 2  louvre accord still in effect japan official says       by kunio inoue       tokyo oct 19    the group of seven g7 industrial nations still comply with last februarys louvre accord to stabilize currencies a senior bank of japan official said     and us treasury secretary james bakers remarks at the weekend indicating the need to revise it do not herald a lower range for the dollar other senior officials from the bank of japan and finance ministry agreed in interviews     the exchange market is apparently reacting too much and anyone who sold the dollar on the baker comment will regret it later on the bank of japan official told reuters     the bank official said baker did not mean to talk the dollar down a lower dollar would harm the us economy he noted     a finance ministry official who was directly involved in monetary talks with other nations also said the us would never attempt to lower the reference range for the dollar against the mark or the yen     the market assumes the dollar reference range to be between 140150 yen and between 170 and 190 marks     the dollar closed in tokyo today at 1773035 marks and 14135 yen     behind bakers remark was us frustration over higher interest rates abroad especially in west germany but this does not represent its readiness to scrap the basic framework of the louvre accord the finance ministry official said     he said that on the contrary baker wanted to avoid any further rise in us interest rates because it would not only hurt the us economy but aggravate the third world debt problem     higher us interest rates would merely raise their interest payment burden and depress us stock and bond markets further the monetary officials said     both the ministry and central bank officials who declined to be named noted the us no longer wants to see a further decline of the dollar because that could also fan inflationary expectations in the us     thats why baker did not fail to add that the louvre agreement is still operative the senior ministry official said     baker said in a us television interview on sunday that washington would reexamine the louvre accord because of west germanys increase in shortterm interest rates     the market at first interpreted this as indicating the us would be ready to scrap the louvre accord and let the dollar decline further unless surplus countries notably west germany try harder to stimulate their economies as pledged in the accord foreign exchange dealers said     but the market on reflection also noted bakers additional statement that the louvre agreement is still operative and this caused some dollar shortcovering in tokyo today the dealers said     uncertainty however remained the flavour of the day in tokyo currency markets     the japanese monetary officials said bakers undisguised pressure on west germany to refrain from guiding interest rates higher may be part of a process of multilateral surveillance or international economic policy coordination     the g7 comprising the us japan west germany britain france italy and canada have agreed to monitor each others economic policies and from time to time apply peer pressure to persuade others to change their policies to a desired course they noted without such a basic agreement of multilateral surveillance baker would never have criticized the west german policy so openly the ministry official said     the uswest german squabble over bonns monetary policy should thus be regarded as a process of healthy policy coordination and not as any indication of a possible collapse of the louvre agreement the official said     he also said japan has not received any specific request from the us on its monetary policy although its shortterm money rates have been edging higher     this is because we unlike the germans are not taking policy to guide interest rates higher and the marginal rate rise in recent days is primarily for seasonal reasons he added  reuter 3 2  philippine inflation predicted to rise       manila oct 19    the philippine 1987 inflation

monitoring us coffee imports under quotas is viewed skeptically by many in the coffee industry said analysts and trade sources     many sectors of the trade including large roasters and  importers are adamant against voluntary compliance because of the past which was subject to tremendous irregularities as it became a matter of the trade monitoring each other one analyst said     on monday a national coffee association newsletter said the office of us trade representative will implement a voluntary compliance system temporarily because legislation to monitor imports is tied up in the congressional trade bill     under the arrangement milar to one in 1980 coffee importers would voluntarily present needed documents to the us government until congress approves the monitoring authority but if coffee arrives without valid certification it will still be allowed entry     while many believe producers will not seek to add to the overburdened stock situation in the us others believe some will ship outside of the quota requirements in lieu of monitoring controls trade sources said     last time there was a lot of false information submitted to customs which resulted in a lot of indictments and fines a us customs spokesman said     customs can do a good job when given the tools but when its hands are tied it doesnt have the authority to demand form o documents tracking merchandise from source to destination he said     many see it as a true test of whether producers and importers will abide by the quota system     it is a key to seeing whether there are any teeth in the quota agreement said one major us roaster      last time we had a gentlemans agreement the trade did not act as a gentleman said another analyst adding without the need to submit documents the ball will be in the producers hands     some feel that importers will take advantage of the voluntary compliance due to development of a twotier market in which nonmember countries buy coffee at a big discount many fear that dealers will buy coffee destined for nonmember countries at discounts and then bring it into the us falsely labelled     according to customs officials several green coffee importers confessed in 1985 that they had imported coffee fraudulently after buying it for nonmember destinations forging landing certificates and then relabelling it as navy beans     if theres that much of a discrepancy between prices for one country and another producers may be teted to get rid of their stocks of coffee by selling to nonmember nations and by circumventing the quota provisions said paine webber analyst bernie savaiko     still others believe that producers will not be hard pressed to aggravate the overburdened coffee stock situation in the us in the near term     it would be naive to suggest that any agreement would not have some share of connivance but i think the voluntary system seemed to suffice and coupled with the fact that we have so much coffee i dont think

wellington oct 19    an income tax surcharge and capital gains tax could bring about an urgently needed depreciation of the nz dollar independent economist len bayliss said     bayliss a former economist with the reserve bank and the bank of new zealand said a major depreciation is needed to restore export competitiveness even if inflation is cut by current government policies     the taxes would help cut the budget deficit which in turn would lower the value of the nz dollar he said in a speech he added that the deficit for the year ending march 1988 could be much higher than the governments 13 billion dlr forecast     since the government was unlikely to cut expenditure as a percentage of gross domestic product a major tax increase was probably unavoidable bayliss said     he would have preferred an increase in the 10 pct valueadded goods and services tax introduced in october 1986 but that would have had a shortterm inflationary impact import tariffs should be lowered to minimise the inflationary impact of a currency depreciation     the government had failed to bring inflation down despite lower oil prices and an appreciation in the currency he added     new zealands inflation rate was 169 pct in the year to endseptember against 189 pct in the year to end june     the major deficiency in the governments antiinflation policies was reliance on high interest and exchange rates and insufficient emphasis on reducing the budget deficit bayliss said the government had also failed to reduce overseas debt and debt ratios and cut the balance of payments deficit     the widespread belief that new zealands problems are going to take much longer to solve than was originally thought is soundly based  primarily because the governments macroeconomic policies have been unsuccessful bayliss said  reuter 3 2  redken laboratories ltrdkno to buy back stock       canoga park calif oct 20    redken laboratories inc said its board authorized management to repurchase up to

share fall absurd       london oct 20    uk chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson said the severity of the current rout on world stock markets was an absurd overreaction sparked on wall street by a spreading lack of confidence in the us economy     lawson said in a bbc radio interview this began on wall street it has a lot to do with the american stock market and a lack of confidence in the us   and some careless talk by those who should have known better     in a further wave of selling this morning in london the ftse 100 index had lost a further 2332 points only 50 minutes after the official 0800 gmt opening to stand at 18191     lawson said a correction on world stock markets was to have been expected after the bull markets of recent years what was not expected was the severity of the downturn which quite frankly is rather absurd     he said he saw no fundamental signs why the us economy should go into recession adding indeed the possibility of higher us interest rates would certainly in my judgment not lead the american economy into a recession     the only way in which the american economy would go into recession was if it actually talks itself into recession he said

stoltenberg are normally so much in agreement that some foreigners doubt the central banks independence     but a rare public row between the ebullient poehl president of the bundesbank and stoltenberg over a controversial investment tax proposal has added to the woes of the countrys already nervous financial markets bankers said     poehl told an investment symposium in frankfurt last thursday he feared the tax would raise borrowing costs and interest rates     stoltenberg quickly issued a statement rebutting poehls criticism saying west germany would remain an attractive place for foreign investors     the obvious lack of coordination between the bundesbank and finance ministry does not instil confidence in foreign investors said one economist for a london broker who asked not to be identified     bankers here expressed confidence the two top financial policymakers would quickly patch up their relationship to steer the economy through a particularly difficult time     there are plenty of objective pressures which will result in things getting back to normal again after a period of ill feeling said commerzbank ag chief economist juergen pfister     news on october 9 that the government was planning a 10 pct withholding tax wiped billions of marks off shares and bonds in a market already reeling from rising interest rates at home and abroad     bankers said the bundesbank was angered by the way the finance ministry announced the plan  without consulting the bundesbank adequately and allowing apparently conflicting details to dribble out into an unprepared and uncertain market     both poehl 57 and stoltenberg 59 have been under extraordinary pressures lately     poehl has had to switch to the hard line promoted by his deputy helmut schlesinger jacking up interest rates to fight inflationary fears and abandoning the pragmatic policies he had pursued so far this year to promote currency stability     in recent statements poehl has sounded more like schlesinger for years the softlyspoken economist has been warning in speech after speech that excessive money supply growth would eventually lead to rising prices     schlesinger now has a majority of support in the bundesbank council and since late summer poehl has had to represent his views bankers said     poehl is in a minority in his own house said commerzbanks pfister     poehl is in a dilemma he must follow a policy that is not entirely his own said another economist     the dilemma is that if german interest rates rise too far they will attract funds into the country pushing up the mark and hurting west german exporters     the dollar has now shed some seven pfennigs since the bundesbanks new tack became clear in early october     since last thursday united states treasury secretary james baker has criticized the bundesbank rate increases     bankers said this could foreshadow a revival of the 1986 war of words between the us and west germany in which us officials talked down the dollar to force west germany to stimulate its economy and thus suck in more us exports     one way west germany agreed to do this was making a round of tax cuts worth 39 billion marks from 1990     but financing these tax cuts has proved more difficult for stoltenberg than he had bargained for     the cool unflappable northerner who was regularly voted most popular government politician last year had to face resistance from local barons in the government coalition parties and from trade unions to his planned subsidy cuts     the withholding tax was intended to plug one gap by raising 43 billion marks     but it has caused an outcry among bankers who say it will push up borrowing costs the extra amount this costs the government could wipe out the revenue the tax brings in     meanwhile stoltenberg is dealing with a local political row which has turned into the countrys worst political scandal     stoltenberg had to leave monetary talks in washington last month early to sort out a row in the northern state of schleswigholstein where he heads the ruling cdu party     the states cdu premier uwe barschel had to resign after allegations of a dirty tricks election campaign led to heavy losses for the cdu in state elections     barschel was found dead in a hotel bath in geneva last weekend police say the death appears to have been suicide     cooperation between poehl and stoltenberg is all the more remarkable as poehl is in the opposition social democrats and was appointed by former chancellor helmut schmidt     when poehls contract came up for renewal earlier this year chancellor helmut kohls cduled coalition government gave poehl another eightyear term     werner chrobok managing partner at bethmann bank said he hoped the two men would soon be of one opinion again     but when poehl criticized stoltenbergs tax plans he was not only voicing what many bankers felt but demonstrating the bundesbanks independence of government chrobok said  reuter

prices will prevent the bank of japan from raising its discount rate and could even force it to ease monetary policy if the collapse continues government and private economists said     a rise in interest rates now would only serve to spark further selling of shares that could ultimately have a major deflationary impact on the real economy they said     although bank of japan officials have consistently maintained that they had no plans to raise the 25 pct discount rate many in the markets have thought otherwise      fears of a rise in the discount rate were fanned by the central banks apparent decision last week to countenance higher rates on commercial bills dealers said     but todays stock market collapse  prices fell nearly 15 pct  means that the bank of japan would be hard pressed to raise the discount rate now despite its concerns about a renewed outbreak of inflation dealers and economists said     japanese government bond prices rose sharply today as the markets concluded that the stock markets collapse precluded the central bank from carrying out the widelyrumoured discount rate increase     a senior government economist suggested that both the us and japan needed to ease monetary policy now to prevent a further drop in new york and tokyo stock prices they need to support the stock and security markets he said     but bank of japan officials said they saw no need to change policy for the moment although one admitted that the central bank may have to rethink its strategy if tokyo stock prices continue to plunge during the rest of the week     both government and bank of japan economists agreed the economy is better placed now to cope with the deflationary impact of plunging stock prices than it was a few months ago     with the economy recovering strongly the steep drop in stock prices is not likely to put a major dent in consumer and business confidence one government economist said     there will be some impact on the real economy but it wont be that big said another     individuals are not heavily invested in stocks on their own although they do participate through trust funds and other investment vehicles and while many manufacturing firms turned to financial market investments for profits during last years economic downturn the recent rebound has allowed them to refocus their attention on their core businesses he said     paradoxically it is the pickup in the economy that is partly to blame for the stock market collapse as companies have shifted funds away from financial investments to increase inventories and step up capital spending one government economist said     in deciding what response to make to the steep stock price drop the bank of japan must first determine whether prices will continue to fall further and then decide if they pose a greater economic danger than the threat of higher inflation one central bank official said that will at least take a couple of days if not weeks he said  reuter

36 pct in the first nine months of 1987 against 52 pct in the same 1986 period     foreign trade in the same period fell 36 pct from the 1986 period as exports fell by 05 pct and imports dropped by 42 pct     foreign trade in the nine months totalled 942 billion roubles separate import and export figures were not given     one factor affecting industrial growth was the introduction of a new quality control plan western economists said last years calculations of industrial output included all goods irrespective of quality     under the new plan introduced in line with soviet leader mikhail gorbachevs drive to modernise the economy special inspectors have the right to reject goods they consider below standard     pravda said 42 mln roubles worth of defective goods were rejected in the

recently to allow the setting up of small shops on a private basis     labour productivity rose 37 pct in the first nine months against 48 pct growth in january to september 1986     but western economists said they treat soviet productivity figures with caution as they are more broadly based than in the west which measures worker output over a given period     pravda said there were 2838 mln people in the soviet union as of october 1 in the january to september 1987 period 1185 mln people were employed a rise of 44 pct on the same period last year average earnings were 200 roubles a month

york oct 19    wall streets biggest oneday drop since 1914 has revived a bitter debate about whether modern investment techniques turn shifts in investor psychology into colossal moves in share prices     the market has gotten away from the players said dudley eppel vice presidentequity trading at donaldson lufkin and jenrette securities corp he says stock index futures and options have distorted the investment process     but wall street professionals who work with index futures and options insist the blame is misplaced     fischer black head of the trading and arbitrage division at goldman sachs and co says socalled program trading strategies involving opposite positions in futures on stock indices and the underlying stocks deserve almost no blame for todays decline people have changed their minds about the future of the economy he said another strategy known as portfolio insurance may have exagerated the decline to a small degree said black     eli wachtel of bear stearns and co was emphatic i do not believe the drop was precipitated by portfolio insurance or expanded by program trading     the only thing that will stop it in the end is the value investor who comes in and says ibm still sells computers and buys for traditional reasons said jeffrey miller of miller tabak hirsch and co     ibm ltibm fell 31 to 104 as the dow jones industrial average dropped more than 500 points     several years ago millers firm was one of the first to pursue program trading strategies seeking to lock in an automatic profit by taking advantage of discrepancies in the prices of the futures and the underlying stocks but he said his firm has not been involved in that since late last year     miller said some investors who were burned in the recent market declines may have miscalculated the effects of portfolio insurance he estimated 70 to 80 billion dlrs in invested funds prior to the decline were hedged with futures     the way portfolio insurance is used miller said investors at the time they protect their portfolios commit themselves to a future course of action such as buying a put option while negative news such as trade deficits and budget deficits build for months the put options tend to be crowded into a narrow span of time because they are executed as the market starts to fall     miller said at present people can only guess how much portfolio insurance is in use he suggested some system of disclosure could put other investors on guard that the seeds were being planted that might add to a future decline     but in any case miller argued that index futures and options do not initiate market trends     people like eppel of donaldson lufkin and jenrette were steadfast in their criticism if i had my way there wouldnt be any index futures he said they propelled the market up when nothing was going on and now were paying the price     another irate trader referring to ibms 31 point drop complained what announcement did ibm make over the

economist for shearson lehman brothers told reuters the 508 point decline represented a crisis of confidence     this is a a bonafide financial crisis the market is showing panic i suspect there is a wholesale deserting of our markets by a lot of foreign investors     sinai said the crisis was caused by continuing us budget and trade deficits and by rising interest rates this is not a signal of the start of a recession but a strong indicator that one is coming if nothing is done in washington to deal with the budget and trade deficits sinai said     some market participants said redemptions by investors who own mutual funds fueled the decline but steve norwitz a spokesman for t rowe price associates a baltimorebased investment management firm said redemptions and switches into money market funds by prices one mln accounts amounted to less than two pct of assets its not a rout by any means         norwitz said the company normally receives about 3500 telephone inquiries from its customers each day on friday he said when the dow index fell 108 points the volme of calls rose to around 7000 and today it exceeded that although he did not have a precise number     ike kerridge an

 the ec and japan have said it is unrealistic     the ec commission this month announced its draft proposal on farm trade reform expected to be tabled at gatt formally next week     the ec scheme involves emergency measures to reduce tensions in troubled surplus sectors of cereals and cereals substitutes dairy and sugar it also calls for reduction of farm subsidies     the us is not opposed to shortterm measures as long as they are directly linked to longterm commitments to end major trade distortions samuels said     washington will review the ec proposal when it is formally submitted and respond to it officially then     we will consider its relation to the punta del este declaration to correct trade problems and expand market access the us ambassador said     the us can say no to the ec proposal if the ec ignores the us plan when it tables its own proposal he added     the key difference between the two approaches is that the us wants farm subsidies eliminated while the ec is pushing only for a reduction in farm suppports samuels said     if the ec farm budget were protected by a subsidy freeze there would be little incentive for the community to work to correct the international trade situation he added     samuels cited the animal hormones complaint the ec oilseeds regime and an ec regulation concerning meat imports to third countries as three crucial barriers to trade which the us wants to see resolved under the auspices of gatt  reuter 3 2  weis markets inc ltwmk sets payout       sunbury pa oct 19        qtly div 11 cts vs 11 cts prior     pay jan six

and west german finance minister gerhard stoltenberg on monday soothed currency markets allowing the dollar to recoup much of the days losses dealers said     news of the meeting which took place in frankfurt in great secrecy came after the dollar fell sharply on criticism by baker of west german monetary policy which had provoked fears that the louvre pact on currency stability was in jeopardy     the dollar reacted immediately to the news rising over two pfennigs in after hours new york trading dealers there said     the announcement of the meeting also attended by bundesbank president karl otto poehl was made simultaneously in bonn and washington timed for after the closure of new york markets     baker stoltenberg and poehl agreed to pursue the policies accepted under the february louvre accord a finance ministry spokesman in bonn said     the dollar rose to 1797090 marks from new yorks close of 1773040 it had closed there on friday at 1797585 marks     the dollar had tumbled nearly three pfennigs as the market reacted to bakers criticism of rising west german interest rates and stock markets crashed worldwide baker had said that west germany was apparently breaching the louvre accord     under the accord leading industrial democracies pledged to coordinate economic policies to foster currency stability with the surplus countries west germany and japan stimulating their economies and the us promising to cut its budget deficit     west german government sources said rising west german money market rates could not be seen as a breach of the louvre pact they were rather a direct reaction to higher interest rates in the united states us bond yields have been rising since may on inflationary fears and in early september the fed raised the discount rate to 600 pct from 550     german yields have also risen over this period but less markedly and since late september the bundesbank has nudged up shortterm rates by changing the terms on its security repurchase pacts its principal instrument for steering the money market     the allocation rate on the last facility was 385 pct compared with 360 pct this was partly due to west germanys inability to uncouple itself from us interest rate trends but also reflected concern among monetary conservatives in the bundesbank central bank council about excessive monetary growth which raised fears of domestically produced inflation bank economists said     this monetary tightening reflected a switch from the pragmatic line pursued by bundesbank president karl otto poehl since early this year to stabilise the mark externally to the more cautious approach of vice president helmut schlesinger     in an apparent gesture to baker coinciding with his visit the bundesbank repeatedly added money market liquidity this morning dealers said this was clearly a move to appease us anger over the most recent west german interest rate rises     they the bundesbank just dont want to come too much under american fire said chris zwermann currency adviser at swiss bank corp here     it seems to me that this is the bundesbank beating quite a significant retreat from its position added giles keating economist at credit suisse first boston ltd in london     the significance that retreat will emerge from the terms of the bundesbanks next tender for a securities repurchase pact on tuesday and its result on wednesday money market economists said     todays injection of liquidity shows that the bundesbank does not want a further strong rise in the tender allocation rate which is likely to turn out at between 380 and 390 pct little changed from the 385 pct on the last facility     the bundesbank and finance ministry had given no indication that the meeting would take place although the finance ministry spokesman said it had been arranged last week     earlier on monday the finance ministry spokesman asked to comment on the apparent usgerman clash over the louvre accord went no further than quoting stoltenberg as saying he assumed monetary cooperation would continue     the spokesman said he believed baker had already left west germany for sweden on monday this week he is also due to

stored in proper conditions does not deteriorate he told reuters in a telephone interview the quality of buffer stock rubber sold since he entered the market in september would be discussed at an inro council meeting which opened here today he said     tokyo traders said on friday they had little interest in buying rubber from the inro buffer stock because of possible poor quality     hofmeister began selling rubber when prices exceeded the maysell level of 232 cents per kg early last month inros fiveday moving average was quoted at 2373 cents on october 16 he said the quality of five to sixyear old rubber in stock was uppermost in consumers minds     we have received good interest for the rubber i understand the japanese concern many consumers want to try the rubber before they carry on buying he said     hofmeister said inro rubber was stored in 28 different locations in producing and consuming nations adding all warehouses used were suitable for longterm storage     selling of buffer stock rubber had levelled off during the past week to 10 days and this could reflect a wait and see attitude by buyers he said     consumers are holding back from buying additional amounts until they test out the rubber if their tests are positiive they are likely to buy more hofmeister said he could reduce the offer price of buffer stock rubber to stimulate interest but inro did not want to depress prices artificially     hofmeister declined to comment on japanese trade estimates that he had sold around 30000 to 32000 tonnes in kuala lumpur and new york since september     but he

washington oct 19    mondays stock market collapse could spell disaster for republican hopes of retaining the white house in 1988  if it proves to be the start of a general economic downturn  political experts said     the question is does the stock market decline signal an impending recession if that is the case the republicans will have a very difficult time winning independent political analyst william schneider told reuters if the democrats nominate anyone halfway credible they would win he added     schneiders comments on the heels of a 500point decline in the bellwheter dow jones stock market average reflected the old political adage that elections are almost always decided by voters feelings about their financial well being     there is no doubt people always vote their pocketbook and we dont expect 1988 to be any different says donald foley the top spokesman for missouri representative richard gephardts democratic presidential campaign     foley added that the fiveyear old stock market rally has shown amazing resilience and theres no telling where the market will be by the end of the week     president reagan said he was puzzled by the days events but is convinced the economy is fundamentally sound     i think everyone is puzzled  because all the business indices are up there is nothing wrong with the economy he told reporters     i dont think anyone should panic because all the economic indicators are solid he added     but for the time being the decline on wall street knocked the underpinnings from his boasts that the record bull market demonstrates the wisdom of current economic policy     it could also deprive the republicans of a major argument for keeping the white house in their hands when president reagan leaves office in january 1989     it gives a hollow ring to the words used by vice president george bush just a week ago when he formally entered the white house race     we have weathered the storm our economy has recovered to be the strongest in history bush said in reference to the recovery from the 198182 recession that pushed unemployment to its highest level since the great depression of the 1930s     we mark next week the longest peacetime economic expansion in our nations recorded history bush bragged     at midday even as wall street was being battered by a record selling panic reagan gave a glowing account of the economys performance at a swearing in ceremony for his new commerce secretary william verity     indeed the labor department reported earlier this month that unemployment among american workers had fallen to an eightyear low of 59 pct in september compared to seven pct a year ago and a post world war two peak of 107 pct in december 1982     but with interest rates climbing steadily and no improvement in the record us trade deficit with the rest of the world a number of economic experts have expressed doubts about the staying power of the current expansion    warnings of economic danger around the corner have been a staple of democratic campaign speeches this year     and democratic party leaders here for an organizational meeting two weeks ago predicted at that time that the economy would be the determining factor in next years election     the 1988 election will be decided as most peacetime elections are on economic issues said michigan party chairman richard weiner     in ohio people are uneasy they want to know where the economy is going added ohio democratic leader james ruvulo     american political history is replete with examples of voters throwing out incumbent officeholders when the economy turns sour  most notably in 1932 when democrat franklin roosevelt won a landslide triumph that ended 12 years of republican rule and made the democrats the nations majority party for more than 40 years     but political experts said that if mondays stock decline turns out to be a temporary phenomena it will have no effect on the 1988 election     times

reagan warned iran of stronger american countermeasures if the military escalation continued     western diplomats and military sources in the area said shelling the platform appeared to be the least provocative act the united states could have taken once it had decided to retaliate for the tanker attack blamed by both the americans and kuwaitis on iran     its interesting that they chose

banking commission hopes to introduce a major reform of the banking system in january which would revolutionise the workings of the countrys unusual liquidity requirements     commission director kurt hauri told reuters the main consequence of the change would be an end to the sharp rise in interest rates which occurs at the end of every month     by effectively reducing liquidity requirements it would also help swiss banks compete better against those in britain west germany and the united states he said     the commission wants to move to a system of average liquidity requirements where banks have to hold reserves equivalent to a certain proportion of their exposure calculated over the month as a whole     the current system described  as a swiss special case by hauri forces banks to comply with requirements generally only at the end of each month     the result is a sharp upward trend in short dated money market rates overshadowed by the approach of the endmonth called the ultimo with consequent high costs for the banks who are forced to borrow extra funds from the national bank     this was particularly pronounced in june 1986 when overnight rates hit triple figures due to a combination of the halfyear end and a rigid adherence by the national bank to its money supply target although the rise shocked the bank into more flexibility the problem remained     the reform proposal which hauri said had been planned for years was given to banks and other interested parties for comment on september 30     they have until the end of this month to suggest alterations

that was the responsible thing to do and if it fits with bakers wishes then all the better he said     no central bank wants to let interest rates rise and the bundesbank had been forced to put its

increase was a cause for concern     giles keating economist with credit suisse first boston ltd in london said the cautious bundesbank has beaten a retreat and baker has won a battlebut he hasnt won

that an accord containing detailed figures and involving immediate penalties for farmers in the case of overproduction must be reached in advance of an ec heads of government summit meeting in december     we require numbers as well as words in all the commodity regimes howe was quoted as saying     the ec commission proposed last month a plan for budgetary stabilisers under which there would be reductions in guaranteed prices restrictions of sales into intervention or increases in coresponsibility levies if output of individual commodities exceeded certain levels     britain has so far given the clearest backing to the idea although several other ec states back it in outline     diplomats say britain can exercise some leverage on the issue because the ec is in a severe budgetary crisis from which it can only emerge if all 12 member states agree to revise the system by which it is financed     the sources quoted howe as saying an interim or partial solution covering some elements of the commission package would be unacceptable to the united kingdom     they said he insisted that any penalties imposed on farmers for exceeding production limits must take effect in the same marketing year as the overproduction rather than resulting in a price adjustment the following year     howe also said there should be no question of a special fund which could top up ec farm coffers in the event of an unexpected development such as a major fall in the value of the dollar     the commission has suggested such a fund to deal with emergency situations     french ec affairs minister bernard bosson told journalists that his country could not accept the idea that there should be no emergency reserve     the british position has become tougher he said     howe was speaking

houston business lunch i believe were going to see a change in the world oil markets in two to three years because oil is becoming harder to find     anderson who retired from arco last year to form hondo oil and gas co said world oil consumption is approaching 60 mln barrels a day but a current excess capacity cushion of about 45 mln barrels a day will rapidly disappear     if you looked around the world you could not scrape up one mln barrels a day in shutin production outside the middle east he said were soon going to be right back where we were in 1973 and 1979     anderson predicted that world oil prices would end 1987 at about 24 dlrs a barrel and continue a gradual climb     theres no way prices can stay flat because there isnt enough supply he said there have been no major oil

would cut repayments on its almost 20 billion lr hard currency debt to bring them in line with its hard currency earning capacity     we have decided to coordinate repayment of our debt with realistically assessed capabilities of our economy he said in parliament he said the current debtservice ratio over 40 pct of export revenue was too high     yugoslavia is to negotiate a longterm restructuring of its debt after missing repayments in recent months mikulic said     if we did not change the dynamics of repaying our debt the situation would become increasingly worse mikulic said     he said on the present repayment schedule yugoslavia would have a net outflow of two billion dlrs and the level of debt would be halved by 1995 but he added     the consequences would not only mean slower economic growth in the coming years but also further exhaustion of the economy and lasting damage to the economys capacity for development he said     all that would of course intensify social difficulties mikulic added     the state news agency tanjug said on october 9 that yugoslavia plans to adjust debt repayments over the next eight years and to cut the debtservice ratio to 25 pct     yugoslavia failed to make a principal repayment due last month which had already been postponed by 90 days     mikulics proposed economic program which also includes higher personal taxes as well as wage and price restraint is intended to serve as a basis for the debt talks to demonstrate yugoslavias ability to eventually repay the credits     his program has to be discussed and approved by parliament by early november     mikulic said foreign debt should be retained at about the same level as now until 1990 and the country should then be able to keep currency reserves equal to three months payments     of course these are our proposals for talks with creditors we expect understanding and support because it is in their interest as well mikulic said     he said that under the present schedule debt payments had slowed economic development and exhausted currency reserves banking sources say yugoslavias reserves are inadequate at present for even one months debt and import

are a cause for concern and the bundesbank has no interest in higher capital market rates bundesbank president karl otto poehl said     we consider the interest rate increase that has occurred here and internationally to be a problem and cause for concern poehl told an investment conference     i would like to stress that the bundesbank has no interest in higher capital market rates he said     shortly after poehl spoke the bundesbank announced a tender for a securities repurchase pact at a fixed rate of 380 pct     previous tenders over the last month by interest rate have seen the allocation rate on these facilities rise to 385 pct at last weeks pact from 360 on the last fixedrate tender in late september     the bundesbanks reduction of the key allocation rate to 380 from 385 pct was heralded monday by repeated injections of money market liquidity at between 370 and 380 pct     these moves to cap interest rates followed a meeting between poehl finance minister gerhard stoltenberg and us treasury secretary james baker monday in frankfurt     officials said afterwards the three men had reaffirmed their commitment to the louvre accord on currency stability     over the weekend criticism by baker of the tightening in west german monetary policy had prompted a sharp fall of the dollar on speculation that louvre cooperation had ended     but the dollar rallied on news of mondays meeting in nervous trading to trade above 179 marks tuesday     poehl said that the recent rise in interest rates was not due to central bank policy but to markets expectations and currency developments     commenting on the inflationary expectations poehl said you have to get to the root of the problem you have to pursue a policy which reveals that there are no grounds for such fears  the inflationary fears were unjustified and exaggerated he said     poehl rebuffed recent us criticism of west germany saying the bundesbank had made a substantial contribution to international cooperation in interest and monetary policy     the bundesbank has tolerated an overshooting of its money supply target arousing criticism from other quarters he said     today we still have lower interest rates than at the end of 1986 quite the contrary of other countries where interest rates have risen substantially more poehl said     this had to be taken into account when considering recent rises in repurchase pact allocation rates which were due to rising international money market rates that had spilled over into the german market he said     poehl expressed surprise that financial markets had so far ignored improvements in the us deficits     the adjustment process in the us trade balance is definitely underway he said noting that this was not so noticeable in absolute figures     the spectacular improvement in the budget deficit had also attracted little attention he said  reuter 3 2  vwr corp ltvwrxo sets quarterly       chicago oct 19        qtly div 20 cts vs 20 cts

oct 19    an announcement by alliant computer systems inc ltalnt of a new lowend nearsupercomputer and lteta systems incs unveiling of a highend machine in the same category show competition is stiff in this market industry analysts said      consultants said alliants new fx computer aimed mainly at scientists and researchers will be priced between 100000 and 200000 dlrs and will be faster than anything else in that price range but they said alliant is trying to bring prices in line with discounts it now gives many of its customers     the new fx is significant to the extent that it represents alliants recognition of the reality of the marketplace said a source who was briefed by alliant on the new computer the list price is more in line with what they are seeing anyway     nearsupercomputers often called minisupercomputers resemble the massive supercomputers favoured by scientists but are much less expensive and a quarter as powerful     supercomputers cost well over one mln dlrs but minisupercomputers are generally priced between 200000 dlrs and one mln dlrs     most nearsupercomputers use a new computer architecture called parallel processing in which a problem is broken up into segments and each segment assigned to a different processor generalpurpose mainframe computers have just one processor that works on one segment of a problem at a time making them too slow for complex scientific problems     nearsupercomputers have been in existence for only about five years and the two leading manufacturers alliant and convex computer corp cnvx held two of the most successful initial public offerings last year     but alliant and convex a texas company are also facing some 15 companies competing for between 200 and 250 mln dlrs in sales this year and the result has been lower prices and shrinking profit margins     heavy discounting slow acceptance outside the scientific market lack of software and too many competitors also have made analysts reassess prospects for nearsupercomputers     jeffrey canin computer analyst with hambrecht and quist said he just added a year to his original growth estimates for the industry he now expects sales to reach 11 billion dlrs in 1991 instead of 1990     in recent weeks both alliant and convex have said their third quarter earnings would be reduced by competitive pricing pressures     alliant said profits for the period will be about five cents a share against eight cents last year although revenues for the period rose to 142 mln dlrs from 86 mln     convex said third quarter earnings will be less than the second quarters 12 cents a share while revenues will rise almost eight mln dlrs over the 1986 third quarter to between 18 and 185 mln dlrs     until now most of the price discounting occurred at the bottom of the product line in nearsupercomputers but eta systems announcement could start squeezing convex and alliant from the top analysts said     eta a subsidiary of control data corp ltcdc introduced two machines that are really fullblown supercomputers similar to those sold by cray research inc the worlds biggest supercomputer maker but at half the price of crays cheapest model the eta10 model p costs 995000 dlrs and the model q is 12 mln dlrs     eta officials told a news conference the new machines may be classified as supercomputers but they are aimed directly at the upper end of the product lines from alliant and convex     acceptance of etas product could be hampered by lack of software analysts said noting this is an issue that faces all parallel processor makers to some degree     because parallel processing is a new architecture that has yet to be widely used third party software vendors have been slow to write programs for the nearsupercomputers     eta however offers a low priced entry into supercomputers for some customers one consultant said     canin cautioned that the price pressures will continue for some time and estimated that five percentage points have been knocked off the gross profit margins of both convex and alliant this year by price discounting     next year he said the two companies will face a new set of problems as they both introduce their second generation of products i am always cautious about the first major product transition  reuter 3 2  market fall discussed at reagan lunch       washington oct 19    president

to eight to 12 billion dlrs this year from four billion dlrs in 1986 securities industry sources said    the japanese had suffered severely from us bond investments and now they are suffering in us stocks said hiroyuki kondo of yasuda trust and banking co ltd     japanese portfolio investment was concentrated in treasury securities until early this year which led to heavy currency losses following the dollars steep decline even though their us bond purchases moderated since then japanese investors continued to suffer losses as bond prices fell sharply in recent months     now the historic fall in the us stock market has stunned japanese investors killing their appetite for us stocks     keita konishi of sumitomo life insurance co said while his firm was not panicked into an

there will be no big wave of japanese investment in the us for the time being said keiji tsuda of nissei bot asset management corp an investment advisory body to nippon life insurance co     its the time to think twice the psychological impact on investors behaviour will drag on considerably he said     the latest turmoil in the financial market was triggered by us treasury secretary james baker

terms of earnings per share us stocks downside potential is now much larger than that ojapanese stocks     while the japanese stock market has also taken a nosedive it could be stabilized by the efforts of large japanse firms     a high percentage of japanese equities are held by companies who will hold on to their stocks and the stocks of other japanese firms in order to strengthen their business ties through this crossholding relationship analysts said     despite the massacare on the wall street japanese investors are not expected to withdraw from us stocks     us equities are in a process to be built in diversification of their portfolios and the portion of them is still very small japanese investors said but it is unclear when the japanese will resume purchasing us stocks and much depends on the dollars stability they said     kondo of yasuda trust said japanese investors are not fully convinced that federal reserve chairman alan greenspan is determined to fend the dollars value and check future inflation in the us     because of uncertainty over the dollars direction and inflation in the us japanese investors have not yet jumped on the treasury bonds despite the latest sharp bond yield rises investors said     konishi of sumitomo life said a us recession is being talked about so it may be time to shift back to bonds but i feel uneasy about buying any us instruments

industry which makes machine tools instruments and other engineering goods increased output by 33 pct in the first nine months of 1987 compared with the same period last year     however this was far

liberalize the global trading system and to include in it trade in agriculture and services such as banking     yeutter made his remarks at a usisraeli trade meeting marking the second year of their bilateral accord the canadianus pact signed by two sides two weeks ago has yet been approved by the us congress and canadian parliament     the two free trade agreements fta would gradually remove tariffs and other barriers to crossborder trade in goods and many services     yeutter said in the aftermath of the canadian and israeli pacts other countries have realized that if they want to continue to have access to the worlds largest market they had better get serious about improving the gatt     the pact with israel he said is gradually increasing shipments both ways and the canadian pact will substantially increase the gross national products in both countries     yeutter also said the canadian and israeli pacts should serve as important precedents for progress in gatt

nations but also for other countries that need to increase trade in order to better their standards of living     yeutter added it was important not to risk the progress made in the israeli and canadian trade pacts by resorting to protectionism     he was referring to trade legislation pending in congress that would force the united states to take retaliatory actions against nations with large trade surpluses with the united states if the countries practiced unfair trade     the legislation was prompted by a growing us trade deficit that hit 156 billion dlrs last year and is still

destruction of wealth and a deflationary impact on the economy said an economist at a us securities house     but other economists said such fears were overblown     because of lower appreciation of corporate or personal assets that much negative impact could be observed in the us said keikichi honda general manager of economic research at the bank of tokyo ltd     but the appreciation of stock prices has not been playing such a major role in the entire us gross national product gnp honda said     the pessimists noted that the record fall on wall street on monday was sparked by fears the us economy is heading for a recession or serious slowdown much earlier than expected     but the optimists said a dampening effect on consumption due to stock market losses was less likely in japan     in japan the weight of stocks in individuals total assets is less than in the us and the total weight of individuals holdings in the stock market is less so there will be less damage than in the us said an economist at one of japans major brokerage houses     japan is taking strong measures to stimulate domestic demand so while there could be some impact from the reduction of assets value it would not be a major impact said the bank of tokyos honda     optimists also pointed to incipient declines in us interest rates as a positive sign for the us economy     us interest rates are coming down so there is a feeling that interest rates have hit their ceiling and the us economy is strong so there should be no direct impact from the collapse of share prices said toshiaki kakimoto sumitomo

until last week a discussion of lower rates was unthinkable now its not said the japanese brokerage house economist     there has been a move from the purely rational to the emotional  its a central bankers nightmare said the foreign economist it will require strong global leadership by politicians to snuff out he said     however previously the stocks correction was due to fears of higher interest rates a possible resurgence of inflation and the depreciation of the dollar said nobuyuki ueda senior economist at the longterm credit bank ltd     now some people have an uneasy feeling

economy he said     if the low levels hold those who were keeping consumption high because of unrealised gains could curb consumption said salomon brothers asia ltd economist ron napier if the paper gains arent there people wont spend     a us recession could then trigger similar declines in other economies some economists said     i dont know if a possible recession in the us would trigger a

also said concerns expressed by 19 state attorneys general in the legal proceedings also favored texacos position     the bottom line is that the sec had intervened to insure that its rule are interpreted properly in the interest of millions of private stockholders around the country who might some day find themselves the victim of this same kind of manipulation decrane told the oilmen

at current vodka prices of 10 roubles a bottle it said this meant illicit alcohol consumption had reached the equivalent of 20 billion roubles a year or annual revenues from vodka sales before the may 1985 antialchohol decree     official statistics show a reduction in consumption of vodka but this is a deceptive statistic  it does not count homebrew pravda said     the epidemic first engulfed the villages and has now also firmly settled into cities where the availability of natural gas running water and privacy has made it much easier     kremlin leader mikhail gorbachev launched the antialcohol campaign shortly after taking office in march 1985 as a first step to improving soviet economic performance which had been seriously hurt by drunkenness among the working population

   us military planners ruled out irans silkworm missiles as a target in the retaliatory attack mounted on monday for fear of being drawn more deeply into the iraniraq war defense and middle east experts said     us naval forces destroyed an offshore oil platform and raided another in what the administration called a measured and appropriate response to an iranian silkworm missile attack last friday on a usflagged tanker in kuwaiti waters     private analysts generally agreed that going after the rig rather than an onshore economic or military target such as silkworm launch sites reflected

take military action norman polmar a defense analyst and author said     he said hitting the platforms had spared iran the embarrassment of casualties on its own soil possibly avoiding an escalating

tuesday they said     japanese political leaders held a flurry of closeddoor meetings today and the three candidates called on nakasone who is due to step down late this month to mediate to break the deadlock     the other candidates are finance minister kiichi miyazawa and former finance minister noboru takeshita     they are vying for the post of president of the ruling liberal democratic party ldp who is automatically prime minister by virtue of the partys parliamentary majority     the new ldp president will be named formally at a party convention on october 30 and elected prime minister

head of the partys largest faction had steadfastly opposed the idea of seeking nakasones help but he told reporters it is possible nakasone will be given carte blanche for selection of his successor     one political analyst who declined to be identified said nakasone despite a personal preference for miyazawa is likely to choose abe as the best candidate for steering japan through its international problems and maintaining party unity abe also would also accept nakasones influence he said analysts said one of nakasones prime aims is to retain as much power as possible following his retirement     takeshita the early favorite because of the size of his faction is viewed by many politicians and analysts as being unsuitable for the post of prime minister because of his lack of international experience     the analysts said nakasone also was very unlikely to support takeshitas bid because of the differences in their political styles  reuter 3 2  athey products corp ltatpco

industry will go through he said shearson recently laid off 150 people in london and is limiting hiring but gerstner said american express remains committed to the london market and to having a global

american express sold 13 pct of its stake in shearson to nippon life insurance co of japan and a further 18 pct to the public gerstner said these moves had no implications of an exit from financial

many securities firms now are stressing merchant banking to bolster earnings hurt by bond market volatility slow retail business and a drop in underwriting volume     when asked if more players would make the system more risky gerstner said i cant comment on other firms but shearson is not going to follow a feeding frenzy in the direction of merchant banking we are not going to overreach     gerstner also spoke about securitization or the repackaging of debt as marketable securities     it is almost imperative to create a security backed by the funds flowing from an ldc lessor developed countries debt program it is going to happen but it is very difficult to create a security in the current climate gerstner said     securitized products could be structured for either the retail or institutional markets gerstner said     if you look at the junk bond phenomenom it started out with mostly institutional buyers primarily through mutual funds individual buyers became a presense in the market id guess wed see a similiar situation in ldc debt he said     the fundamental thing that has to happen before there can be sucessful securitization is that the debt burden on the countries has to be reduced and the amount of money coming from the commerical banks and the future call for money on commercial banks has to be reduced gerstner said  reuter 3 2  gulf peace plan said to call

official washington sought to restore investor confidence after mondays wall street collapse treasury secretary james baker came under fire from critics who claimed he helped to precipitate the crisis     bakers weekend blast at the west german bundesbank for boosting interest rates seemed to signal an unraveling of an international accord to stabilize currency values     nigel lawson british chancellor of the exchequer was among those who said the treasury secretarys statements helped spur a wave of stock sales by making already jittery investors think that a clash between the two major economic powers would damage the world economy     lawson told a london television interviewer tuesday i think the scale of the stock fall was very great that i think was partly due to statements that have been made by senior figures on the other side of the atlantic it was a dispute that should never have happened he added     although baker appeared to patch over the rift at a hastilycalled meeting with west german officials monday he   still faced a storm of criticism on his return to the united states on tuesday baker cut short a longplanned trip to scandinavia to return here to deal with the economic crisis     said one us analyst of bakers weekend remarks his timing could not have been worse     one government bond salesman in new york said he actually thought that yelling at the germans and threatening to smack the dollar down would work that doesnt show much understanding of international monetary gamesmanship     however some analysts said west germanys stubborn march toward higher interest rates may have forced bakers hand     on the surface baker may look responsible for this but if you go back to see what caused it unsettling of financial markets it was west german policy said robert brusca of nikko securities international in new york     all mr baker did was to mention the obvious in public so making him responsible for it was a little like killing the messenger he said     after mondays talks the us and west german governments made it clear that the louvre currency accord pieced together in paris in february was still in effect     wall street feared that collapse of the agreement might be a prelude to hyperinflation and economic malaise similar to the late 1970s analysts believe mondays wall street crash wiped out about 500 billion dlrs in stock values    treasury sources said that baker already unhappy about bonns refusal to stimulate its economy in order to keep the global recovery moving was angered by a bundesbank interest rate boost that seemed destined to do just the opposite     he felt that the us recovery inching along in its 59th month could no longer be the only engine of global economic expansion a growing us economy has been serving as a huge market for debtor country exports     moreover baker the consummate politician was worried that the republican party might face next years presidential election with its main showpiece  a vibrant economy  badly tarnished     a rise in global interest rates might worsen the debt crisis and completely choke off us economic growth that has already slowed to a tepid 32 pct annual rate     theres no doubt that it can have an adverse effect on the economy and its important that the psychology turn around quickly or else obviously the panic will feed on itself and

was stunned by the sudden wall street retreat with president reagan speaking for most people by admitting that he was puzzled     us government sources said the secretary immediately returned to the
